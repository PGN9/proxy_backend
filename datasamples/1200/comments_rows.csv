Ask what they usually like and from where, go get a bunch of it, and drop it off at noon on that day. Use that opportunity to talk face to face with some of the attorneys and leave your cards. Emphasize how you‚Äôve got a new office which allows you to fit any injured client of theirs in immediately (they love that) and you‚Äôre very receptive to structuring your notes in a way that can help the client and their case (they also love that).

n3kl9zf,1m1w48n,chiropractic,Independent-Mood-673,"This is all foreign to me too. I just went full-time into my own practice a few months ago, and I‚Äôve been figuring it out as I go. My overhead is super low, and instead of throwing money into ads, I literally went door to door to every gym and fitness studio in my area and pitched free recovery events. I set up my table, gave out mini massage demos, and just talked to people. That‚Äôs been way more effective for me than any online marketing.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI‚Äôve run ads before, but early on, I think it‚Äôs mostly a money pit unless you have everything else dialed in first (killer close, clear process, strong retention, etc.). Untapped local potential should be maxed before you start fighting for scraps online with boosted posts and split testing 20 ad variations.

As for systems:
	‚Ä¢	I outsource all my insurance billing to a company that takes 11%.
	‚Ä¢	I wear every other hat right now (reception, marketing, operations, patient care).
	‚Ä¢	I built a 2-visit close system that delays adjustments until visit 2 to build buy-in, commitment, and urgency. It‚Äôs helped increase my conversion massively.
	‚Ä¢	I keep my scripts simple and value-focused. I tie everything back to patient goals‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs performance, longevity, or just being able to sleep without pain.

That combo helped me grow from 15 visits per week to 45 per week, and I‚Äôve hit 15 new patients in back-to-back months. My net profit has been about $13k the last couple months‚Äîand that‚Äôs with no staff.

I‚Äôm still learning the PI game too. Right now, I‚Äôm building relationships one attorney at a time, mostly through local networking and referrals from patients who have been in accidents. Not perfect, but it‚Äôs real.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Would having our current chiropractor stay on temporarily help with onboarding or patient retention?
-Yes, it would be best to stay for at least 6 months to a year to ensure a smooth transition for patients and to allow the purchasing doctor to become accustomed to your unique technique and practice flow.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Do buyers usually value having the previous doctor introduce patients to the new chiropractor?
-YES YES YES. You‚Äôre selling your business and the new doctor wants to make sure they retain as many of those patients as possible to make it financially valid.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Is it helpful or expected to provide training in our specific technique?
-ABSOLUTELY!

‚Ä¢	‚Å†How important is continuity in staff or branding to most 
-this can vary from person to person. Some docs may want to slowly implement their own branding, but I think continuity of the staff is more important as your current staff already is accustomed to how your clinic operates and will save the new doctor a lot of time and potential downtime in finding new hires.

n3ocjxs,1m2c8i9,chiropractic,Rcjhgoku01,"You‚Äôve gotten some very good answers so far, especially u/DolmiPshur.  I‚Äôd second what they said.  A couple of other points:

- The #1 thing will always come down to price.  I think that DCs tend to overvalue things like brand and the loyalty of the patient base but most of the practice value really lies in real estate and equipment.  The DC who is buying your practice is really just buying the opportunity to try to retain your establised, current patients.  A number of them will take you leaving as the opportunity to shop around.  


- This is especially true if your practice is a solo, ‚Äúpersonality based‚Äù practice.  In that case your patients have loyalty to you, as an individual, and not the practice itself.  Now, if your practice is systems based with multiple DCs that is less of an issue.  For example, in my practice we have 4 DCs, we all practice the same techniques, and patient‚Äôs visit to visit may/will see a different DC.  If one of us left, we would take a hit but not a huge one as all patients are ‚Äútrained‚Äù to be a patient of the practice, not an individual DC. 


- If your technique is very unique that will make things more difficult as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve (smartly) taught your patients that there‚Äôs something special about it and the way you do it.  Now you (and the new DC) have to convince them he/she can do it as good as you can.",2025-07-17 18:20:58+00,7,t3_1m2c8i9,https://reddit.com/r/Chiropractic/comments/1m2c8i9/advice_on_selling_my_chiropractic_practice_what/n3ocjxs/,,,,,,

n3ojpis,1m2c8i9,chiropractic,Chaoss780,"1. My transition was 1 month. It was perfect. Any longer and I would have been annoyed at the length. But it 100% helped with patient retention.

2. Basically the other doc would just talk me up to the current patients. Some of the long-term ones were introduced individually which was nice. 

3. If the patients expect it, yes. If I were the incoming doc I would probably end up adjusting the ""old"" patients in their preferred style, but the new patients in my own. Don't want to rock the boat too much off the bat. 

4. I'd imagine it's super helpful. The staff I inherited were atrocious. Got rid of them less than 2 months after taking over. If you have solid staff though, this is a HUGE perk. If the systems behind the chiropractor are solid, he'll have less stress, and the transition will go a lot smoother. Same answer with branding as #3...

n3tdkyq,1m2vm49,chiropractic,strat767,"I feel that while we are in school, many of us are told that not getting an audible release from the joint is okay, and that we still put motion into the joint. I think that this is often done when instructors are trying to reduce the burden the student feels from being unsuccessful multiple times, the instructor also lets themselves off the hook for being unable to coach the student to success, and they also save the student patient from a 4th, 5th, 6th attempt.

The students readily accept this explanation because it is easier to accept that an audible release is not necessary than it is to accept that your skills may be severely lacking.

Many doctors carry this into practice and in my opinion become far too comfortable delivering what I would consider, unsuccessful adjustments.

Although an audible release may not be necessary for clinical benefit to occur, I tend to agree with what doctor Lenard Faye expresses in his book ‚ÄúChiropractic Odyssey‚Äù where he states that the audible release is the only way to know that the desired movement or gapping of the joint has occurred. It is the ‚Äúproof‚Äù so to speak, and it should be sought after when treating.

Additionally, patients are good historians of the success of an adjustment, especially trained patients like chiropractors themselves. I think many of us have had an adjustment during our training that just ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt quite right‚Äù or ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt quite get it‚Äù patients can have this feeling as well, where they are aware that the segment which was needing relief, does not feel relieved.

In this case, it is foolish to ignore the patients feeling, and to instead declare the intervention successful on your authority as the doctor alone.",2025-07-18 13:44:10+00,1,t3_1m2vm49,https://reddit.com/r/Chiropractic/comments/1m2vm49/explain_this_to_me/n3tdkyq/,,,,,,

If someone has a goal of losing weight and they say so, supporting them is awesome, but it's ultimately important to focus on well-being and healthy choices rather than how their body looks.

People come in all shapes and sizes, some people are healthy in a larger body. And some people in larger bodies are not healthy and need support.

n3wxlli,1m39y6v,chiropractic,Hiheyhello444,"CMS just posted a bulletin encouraging providers to implement remote health and wellness programs for patients to stay engaged in their health at home. Since 2015, it's mainly been for primary care doctors as a preventative program to address chronic conditions, but now since 2022, remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM) covers a wide range of ailments of all ages and is offered to DC's, physical therapists, assisted living facilities, even pharmacies.

It's an additional revenue stream for practices without additional work. It's mainly a personalized health and wellness program for your patients to keep them engaged in their health through fun, simulated, evidence-based activities like skiing, rock climbing, tennis, white water rafting, etc. Also, there is a BrainHealth+ program for virtual brain training and memory care.

The main goal is to help patients remain healthy and independent at home for as long as possible, addressing 2 main challenges: falls and Alzheimer's. It reduces both by improving balance, ROM, flexibility, and coordination, plus the BrainHealth program focuses on memory care. The program compliments your practices care. There is no cost to the patient (covered by insurance) or practice (no start up fees, no equipment purchase, etc.) and the practice can have 1 or hundreds of patients enrolled. 

A licensed clinician will design their health program and coach them every step of the way. All billing is done under the credentialed programs NPI. Your practice collects a $25 administrative service fee for reviewing your patients monthly progress report (typically takes less than 1 minute). You can add notes to their progress report about exercises.

You will be paid per project, but each year, the projects get longer/more tedious, and your pay lowers by 10% per year. You'll start around 100k. The next year, you'll get more projects, but your pay per project is lower, so you'll still make about 100k. Repeat. Repeat. Eventually, you cannot take on any more projects, but since the pay per project continues to go down, around year 5 you realize that you're getting paid less than half per project, and you're taking on dramatically more. You need to hire staff just to keep up, which only cuts into margins. 

Meanwhile, at office #2, your pay per project never changed. You started with fewer projects, scaled/grew slower, and now, you're getting paid more due to the lack of pay regression.

n408h7x,1m39y6v,chiropractic,Croquetteruns,"Absolutely, I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre making that point. It‚Äôs important for patients to know we are not there to shame them about their weight. I‚Äôm actually clinically obese myself, but very active and I often tell my patients the activities I‚Äôm doing over the weekend or the sports I participate in. I can tell it surprises them sometimes when they figure out I‚Äôm knowledgeable about running or lifting, especially with younger patients. I‚Äôm fully convinced we need to stop talking about physical activity as a weight loss tool, and instead frame it as a healthy aging tool and stress relief. I make a point to tell patients how clear the difference is between my septuagenarians who are active and those who are sedentary, while making clear health issues can also arise in anybody. I often mention brain health too and stress reduction training. I‚Äôm sending patients info about respiration exercises more often too.

To answer the initial question, I mention physical activity to almost every patient, but I don‚Äôt stress the guidelines to everyone. If the patient is sedentary since a long time, I tell them to start small and build on it. Saying 150 minutes to someone who is sedentary and overwhelmed or someone whose life is super busy is counterproductive I think. I‚Äôd rather they focus on being proud of having done a 10 minute walk everyday than feel guilty for not doing the whole 150. Eventually, they can build up from there.

I know someone who petitioned a fiance‚Äô visa during Trumps first term.   Turnaround on the visa was lengthened dramatically due to the severe cuts in staff at immigration services.  The visa finally came and the lady came to join her fianc√©. They got married well within the 90 day window and filed for permanent resident status a green card.   The green card came just in time before she would have had to return due to long processing times..   Not due to her error or any nefarious acts. An attorney advised her to stay as the paper work ‚ÄúShould be here any day.‚Äù  Turns out, it arrived about a week before her other papers expired. 

This is what concerns me about cases like the one in this article.  It is totally possible that the chiro did everything right but the agency, due to staff cuts, took extra long to send the green card.

That is far from nefarious, far from ‚Äúworst of the worst.‚Äù  If he has a job, then he is paying taxes, paying into SS and, unless he is a complete dumbass, following all laws.

There are many reports that these cases seem to be created by slow turnaround on forms and applications.  Whether that is selective slowness or even reticence, I do not know.   

Should this story be posted on a chiro board? Well, it is a chiro and it is someone struggling to practice legally. How many chiros are in the same boat? I have heard of some Canadian chiro students in the US  trying to segue from student visa to green card.  I have no idea whether they are having as much trouble as this Iranian immigrant.

it sounds like those who seem to feel this is a ‚Äúcut and dried‚Äù case, ‚Äújust go back where you came from‚Äù have never considered what it would take to abandon your family. Never considered what it would take to return to a country where your, and your family‚Äôs life are at risk the moment you cross the boarder.

My patients come in like 6-10 times at the most and I have a day sheet and ledger which tracks their attendance and payments. So my patients are tracked in each deposit in the ether somewhere, my EHR tracks the payments (pay as you go). 

As for services, what do I care if I billed out X amount of adjustments and Y amount of exercises? I provide the care the patient needs, I don't need to have a number hanging over my head. It's going to subconsciously make me want to hit some arbitrary quota and then I'll be providing services patients don't need just to hit my number.

I really think on my least crashing days it's been eating much like a cow, grazing on carrots, bok choy, celery, bell peppers over the span of the day in no particular order and more spread out. This obviously flies in the face of all the intermittent fasting trends but I think it's a way to not force your body to make the big switch up you just described perfectly after a big meal.

Village population is 250 in an Amish area in NE Ohio. Many other DC';s around the area too.

Sunday - 8-12  
M,W,F - 8:30 -12:00 -  2:00 - 6:00  
Tues 12:30 - 6:00  
32 hr/week, Closed Sunday PM, Tuesday AM, Thursday and Saturday

I schedule every 30 minutes at the top and bottom of the hour. Often I do 4 in the hour when a parent comes with children.  
I schedule 1 hour for a new adult client. Thorough exam, we talk and discuss their concerns.  
I adjust from foot to head. Also wash out ears as needed.  
1/2 children, 1/2 adult  
Annual income at $100,000. 100%Cash

I could schedule more and see more in the time I have, but I chose not to usually. Sometimes I see people after hours when something comes up for them. I used to make a lot of house calls when I began because I moved here without knowing anyone and opened a business on the recommendation of the Village Mayor who was also a medical doctor (D,O) in this village in 1994. I had no business and started from scratch. My wife worked when we moved here. I renovated a garage into my office at the first location.

I don't need much to live on. A widower for 10 years. Money had more value in the 1990's than today as well.  
Office is attached to the house.

Money is needed to pay bills and live on, yes. I'm not motivated by money. Other DC's close by within 10 miles charge about what I do.....$35.  For me it's adults -$35; $30 - children, No Charge for widows or dependents under 18 when no father is living. Colleagues 20-25 miles away charge $60/visit or more. They also have employees and overhead for business rental or ownership of a separate building too.

2023 - Income - $100775;   New Patients - 254;  Total Patient Visits - 3008  
2024 - Income - $ 99,460;   New Patients - 222;  Total Patient Visits - 2982",2025-07-20 12:51:03+00,1,t1_n441fo6,https://reddit.com/r/Chiropractic/comments/1m3hug6/insurance_vs_cash_based/n45pd7k/,,,,,,

In the early years of the 20th century, American doctors recommended three heavy meals a day, laden with meat ‚Äî steaks, roasts, bacon and ham. But the influencers of the day took a contrarian view: They advocated lighter eating or vegetarianism, sometimes flaunting their own physical fitness to bolster their case.  
  
More than a century later, the same debates are still raging, but the party lines are more complicated. Doctors have embraced lighter eating, influencers exist for every lifestyle choice under the sun, and US public-health departments are overseen by their own influencer, who touts the health virtues of beef fat and shows off his physique. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‚Äôs role as secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services has brought his often contrarian views in direct conversation with government policy ‚Äî as encapsulated in the initiative known as Make America Healthy Again.

A genetic test may one day predict a child‚Äôs risk of¬†[obesity in adulthood](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obesity-dipped-us-adults-rcna183952), paving the way for early interventions.

Certain genetic variants can affect how a person‚Äôs body stores fat or make them more prone to overeating. Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.

In a¬†[study published Monday](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03827-z)¬†in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people ‚Äî the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.

From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what‚Äôs known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a¬†[higher BMI in adulthood](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obesity-wont-solely-defined-bmi-new-plan-global-experts-rcna187724).

The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person‚Äôs risk of obesity as an adult ‚Äî before they even turn 5.

‚ÄúChildhood is the¬†[best time to intervene](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/new-guidelines-treating-childhood-obesity-include-medications-surgery-rcna64651),‚Äù said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen‚Äôs Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)

The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled,¬†[according to the World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight).

Strongly consider being a PT. Your reinbirsements are higher as an out of network PT much much higher and all MD's or DO's always refer to PT vs some refer to chiro. PT is the way to go both from a business owner/referral standpoint.
what I find as a chiro is: some patients choose to see me, have a follow up with their primary, discuss back pain, primary recommends PT. Alot of patients blindly follow their primary care dr's recommendation no matter how much you educate them on chiro. So you have to educate patients on core strength at home or you may lose the patient to a PT because PT's spend more time with them bc their reinbursements are higher so they compare that to your 10 minute appointment with less insurance coverage than what they get for PT.

n4dxh0g,1m5c7tk,fitness,tigeraid,"Proper strength training IS stretching.  Or rather, it's mobility training.  If you want to be able to squat down properly and sit there without pain, you need to learn to squat.  Stretching has little to do with it.

Experts and the science pretty much universally agree that you need strength training.  For safety and quality of life, not to mention bone density, especially as you age.

This can be as basic bodyweight exercises, or some basic dumbbell/kettlebell work at home, it doesn't have to involve the gym. In fact if you have a physical job or hobby that INVOLVES moving things that are heavy, that can be the same thing--carpentry, landscaping, concrete work, mechanic, things like that.

But you MUST do some kind of resistance training to build muscle if you want to live a good QUALITY life.  Having good muscle mass means a far FAR lower risk of nagging aches and pains from a variety of daily activities, from carrying groceries to walking up steps.  It also gives much better odds of recovering FROM injuries, whether it's falling when you slip on ice, or even from major surgeries or cancer treatments.

Society as a whole does have an obesity problem, but I think I agree with Mark Bell more and more these days that it has almost EQUALLY a problem with society being UNDERMUSCLED.

You will not look like an IFBB Pro bodybuilder if you do a little strength training.  You'll just look slightly fitter and be way, way better off.

You'll probably be in better shape than your average american. But you won't be what I would consider fit. You will likely develop knee and back issues by your 30s and 40s still, because you won't have strengthened the soft tissue surrounding these joints. 

Stretching is useless unless you develop strength through that increased range of motion. Stretching will also not help with tight muscles, because muscles are tight for a reason. 

Often times muscle tension comes from weaknesses that other muscles are compensating for, to the point where it gets overworked, tight, and eventually strained. Stretching can temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but the weakness still exists. 

Resistance training doesn't even take all that much time or effort. Realistically, most people will get a ""good"" quality of life, with 20-30 minutes of bodyweight training, done twice a week.

n4dzvi2,1m4kbt5,fitness,rahomka,"You'll lose weight by eating less calories, you'll build muscle and get stronger by going to the gym.  Progress on either of those takes time and you should try to make the most of it.

First of all start religiously tracking your calories and weight with an app like MacroFactor, Cronometer, or MyFitnessPal. Don't worry about a diet or plan just yet, just start tracking to establish a baseline.  To lose about 1lb a week you will need to eat about 500 calories a day less than your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).

Exercise will increase your TDEE but don't really worry about that or try to ""add"" back calories into your food tracker.  You can undo an hour on the treadmill with a few bites of food.  If you are consistently excercising the exact amount of calories you burn exercising doesn't really matter because it's just part of your baseline TDEE.

To build muscle and strength you should follow an actual plan.  There are several in the wiki of this subreddit that you could pick from here: https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/",2025-07-21 18:43:30+00,4,t1_n4daij6,https://reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1m4kbt5/daily_simple_questions_thread_july_20_2025/n4dzvi2/,,,,,,
n4e0fdb,1m22ltz,fitness,ganoshler,"You have to work on both in parallel. (I'm a USAW-L2 coach.) If your question is just about the order of lifting in a workout, it's competition lifts first, strength lifts after.

For the competition lifts, work on technique, but don't be afraid to lift as heavy as your abilities allow. If you're missing (failing) lifts at a certain weight, take some weight off so you can practice making the lift. But if the bar is moving well, there's no need to keep it super light. 

*At the same time*, make sure your workouts include strength work also. Don't stop squatting. *Do* add pulls and lift-offs that prioritize weightlifting positions. So, for example, do ""clean deadlifts"" where you keep the same body positioning as a clean. It will be very different from a conventional deadlift since you're staying over the bar at the start, scooping your knees under a little, etc. 

As you get better at the competition lifts, you'll get more of a strength stimulus from your work with the competition lifts. Weightlifters typically train 1-2 competition lifts followed by 1-2 strength lifts (mostly squats and pulls) in the same workout. 

Here's the general order:

\* Warmup/activation lifts, if you're using them

\* Technique primers - ie drills that will help you to do the next exercise better. These can be their own exercise, or they can just be things that you do with the empty bar as you're starting in on your competition lifts for the day.

\* Competition lifts. If you're training snatch and clean & jerk the same day, snatches would usually go first.

\* Squats and/or pulls

\* Isolation exercises, conditioning work, and/or extra bonus strength work (pull-ups, dips, etc) would go last if your workout has these. 

Presses (like a standing strict press) can go pretty much anywhere - do them before the competition lifts if you want to think of them as a warmup or primer, or stick them at the end with isolations if they're just in there for extra strength work.",2025-07-21 18:46:06+00,1,t1_n3wwwhb,https://reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1m22ltz/daily_simple_questions_thread_july_17_2025/n4e0fdb/,,,,,,

n4e1qkw,1m22ltz,fitness,ganoshler,"Both are valid! Sets are easier to keep track of your progress (for many people). A lot of research on muscle building will count sets, and assume that you're getting a decent amount of rest between sets. So if you do a certain number of ""hard sets"" that's an easy way to know if you're getting a good amount of challenging exercise. 

But you could totally do things the way you describe. One way is to have a target number (like 70) and do them in as few sets as you can. So maybe the first day you do 7x10 and a week or two later you're doing 20, 20, 20, 10, and then when you start to do sets of 25+ you might say, these are getting too easy, so I'm going to switch to kneeling ab rollouts and see how many sets it takes me to do 50 of those. When those get easy, maybe you're ready to move on to the standing kind. Or if we're talking about a weighted exercise, you'd add weight. 

You can also check out ""density training"" which is a similar idea but where you track how many reps you can do in a set time, such as 10 minutes, resting as needed while the timer is still going.

n4e6pz2,1m5jxn5,health,TurtleTerror8,"There‚Äôs a 2017 paper that tried to quantify this, they define a ‚Äútelomeric brink‚Äù at around 5 kb of leukocyte telomere length (LTL), which they associate with a high risk of death.

They looked at people of different ages and telomere lengths and estimated that even under current life expectancy, a decent chunk of people, especially those who start with shorter telomeres, will hit that brink (yes your telomerase length is at least partially inherited). If we all lived to 100, a much larger percentage would run into critically short telomeres. For example, someone in the bottom 20% for LTL at age 35 has a \~50% chance of hitting the brink in their lifetime, and over 90% if they live to 100.

So yeah, even if we cured every disease and dealt with senescent cells, telomere attrition could still be a final boss.

n4efq8l,1m5jxn5,health,TurtleTerror8,"Certain types of stem cells (hematapoetic stem cells, intestinal stem cells, and hair follicle stem cells) do express telomerase, but not quite at the same levels as cancer cells, germ cells, and embryonic stem cells. These types of cells need lots of replenishment within the body, because gut cells/hair cells/blood cells require lots of turnover, and because these types of stem cells express certain levels of telomerase, they can kind of overcome the built-in division limit (the Hayflick Limit). 

  
Telomerase helps stem cells divide longer by slowing telomere shortening, but it doesn‚Äôt make them truly immortal. In adult stem cells, telomerase levels are usually moderate, enough to extend their lifespan but not enough to maintain telomere length indefinitely. By contrast, embryonic stem cells/germline cells/certain cancers have high telomerase activity and additional safeguards, allowing for sustained division during development or across generations.

  
So telomerase does gives some stem cells a longer functional life, they‚Äôre just still subject to eventual limits, just on a longer leash than most other cells. 

What I‚Äôm not entirely sure about is whether stem cells express telomerase at levels high enough to avoid becoming the 'weakest link', that is, a limiting factor in tissue maintenance and a driver of aging-related decline. Maybe their telomerase activity is sufficient to sustain function for most of the human lifespan, I'd have to read more papers if I wanted to learn that! 

  
Long story short: certain types of stem cells (not all) can express telomerase, but it's not necessarily enough for them to ""live forever"" like other cell types.",2025-07-21 19:58:40+00,7,t1_n4e7ttc,https://reddit.com/r/Health/comments/1m5jxn5/bryan_johnson_is_going_to_die/n4efq8l/,,,,,,

M,23,175cm, 72kg, i am cooked.

I want to start take care of my health as i work 14 hours everyday sitting, i don't have time for anything right now and my body is straight up breaking down so i want to spend that 1 hour before bed taking care of my health.

I usually research a lot but i just don't have time now so i would really appreciate it if someone could guide me a bit for this.

I need to fix posture,flexibility(lower body especially) and strengthen up.

For posture i have some previous videos saved(Conor Harris) so ill work with that for now and flexibility can wait, dont wanna ask much. Now for strength.

I have a pair of dumbbells and some elastic bands. I need a workout mainly focused on upper body with dumbbells and bodyweight exercises. Every muscle with some focus on opening? my chest cuz my posture is cooked. Im fine aith 4-5 days even 6. I would really appreciate it if you could recommend anything pdf, links , YouTube videos and maybe recommend some good exercises to add to the workouts you recommend that would better suit my needs(upper body mostly,80-20) .

Like I tell anyone, before getting into a career, make an informed decision that this profession is something you can make a living with and one that you are willing to stick it with for a while.

Shadow a couple doctors and ask for the honest truth about their perspective on the profession-- the good and bad.

Calculate how much money you think you will need to be comfortable and find out what type of chiropractor you have to be to make that much. (Associate, business owner, partnership, etc)

Figure out if the debt is worth the career. If it's about the money and career opportunity, there are far more cheaper ways to make a lot of money in a career that won't take so long.

If you like helping people in need, great! But does that equal healthcare?

I suggest digging deep on this one before making the final decision. (Coming from someone who regrets and embraces this career)",2025-07-21 21:51:11+00,1,t3_1m5pct4,https://reddit.com/r/Chiropractic/comments/1m5pct4/switching_career_paths/n4f2sgk/,,,,,,

If you can't lower the weight enough to do the exercise cleanly, you can switch to doing other types of squats (like goblet or body weight squats).

You can also try a wider stance or raising your heels to make the movement easier at first.

Use the gym and strength training to build general athletic qualities for long-term athletic development, especially for a teenager - too much specialisation can have negative outcomes later down the track. 

Use the sport practice and training to get better at the sport. Use the gym to build general athletic qualities and get exposure to other demands so you're well-rounded. USTA has recommendations for things like trap bar deadlifts, squats, pullups etc. If you really want some focus areas, shoulders, wrist and elbow would be beneficial for supporting the forces involved in the swing; plyometrics and change of direction drills for the movement aspect supported by general strength work like squats, single-leg work etc.",2025-07-22 05:42:27+00,5,t1_n4h2k7x,https://reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1m5c7tk/moronic_monday_your_weekly_stupid_questions_thread/n4h6v8q/,,,,,,

I need your advice as I am not sure how I can combine weights with bouldering and cycling.
I have been doing Upper Lower split 4-5 days per week for the last year or so with great results both in strength and size. Recently I started bouldering with some friends and I have been loving it! The combination of Weights and Boulders was a bit heavy on the joints and tendons in the beginning but still I made it work! However, I recently got a great bike as a gift and I want to start cycling and I am not sure how to combine everything properly.

Right now I think of below programming but please give any advice or ideas

Monday: Lower Body 
Tuesday: Bouldering and right after Upper Body (Pull ups, Dips, Rows and Push Ups) 
Wednesday: Cycling 
Thursday: Bouldering and right after Upper Body ( Pull ups, Dips, Rows and Push Ups) 
Friday: Rest or Lower Body 
Saturday: Upper Body + Cycling 
Sunday: Bouldering longer session

My aim, is to keep muscle as I get better with bouldering and cycling. Or if possible gain some.",2025-07-22 09:27:57+00,1,t3_1m4kbfd,https://reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1m4kbfd/victory_sunday/n4huy74/,,,,,,

My ""plan"" so far is to replace hack squat and leg press with barbell squats and DB lunges.

n4jaxus,1m634t7,chiropractic,soluclinic,"First of all I would get off social media, it doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs good for your mental health.   

I was in the last year and was dealing with the same thing.  I wanted to quit and go to medical school (not DO).  I talked to the president of the school and told him my concerns with the profession and my concerns about my ability to make money after I graduate.   He didn‚Äôt try to defend anything, he just told me basically it would be financially idiotic to not graduate at this point.  It was good advice, and so I pushed through and graduated (was awarded the philosophy award at graduation even though most would call me medipractor, chiropractic philosophy is a beautiful thing in my opinion, and it‚Äôs so important to know our history and what the founders really did and practiced).  

Graduated school and then had a child so going to medical school really didnt work so I opened my practice and struggled for the first five years to make a good living.  From 5-10 I started to really figure it out and now at 15 years and in my mid 40s I‚Äôm objectively making really good money in chiropractic.   

Surround yourself with positive people, and people who you know are probably going to get the business part of chiropractic figured out.  Stay away from students/chiropractors who hate chiropractors who don‚Äôt think or practice the way they do, these are toxic people and are only out for themselves, you know who I am talking about.  

There are so many problems with chiropractic and chiropractors and it‚Äôs a tough profession.  But hang out with any other medical profession or spend some time in corporate and you find out everybody talks shit about each other and wish they did something else.  

Being a chiropractor isn‚Äôt easy but it‚Äôs what you make it, just like anything else.

n4jbf2t,1m5c7tk,fitness,dssurge,"A lot of it has to do with the quality of the chest press machine. The factors to consider are the ergonomics of the machine (how comfortable it is to use for **your** anatomy,) range of motion of the handles, and to a much, *much* lesser extent the force curve on the machine.  

If the machine fits your anatomy well, I would consider it a good machine all other factors aside. Tons of people have gotten jacked using otherwise poorly designed machines. Getting big and strong is about consistency more than any other factor.

For the handle ROM, the bottom should be very close to your body, as if doing dumbbell pressing. There is sometimes a foot pedal to move them forward so you can get in and out of the machine easily. 

Force curve is worth looking into yourself if you're interested in what makes some machines better than others, it's just both not super important and hard to summerize in a short reply.

All of that said, you should consider trying to use barbells on your own. You don't need to lift the heaviest thing you can (nor should you) to get meaningful strength and size results. If you select a weight you can do for 7-8 reps and then only do sets of 5 you will experience gains in a very safe manner. Growth is about proximity to failure, and if you don't think you can get another rep, just rack the bar. As you get more experienced you'll get a lot better at assessing if you have the gas for another rep or 2.",2025-07-22 14:59:13+00,2,t1_n4ikgcy,https://reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1m5c7tk/moronic_monday_your_weekly_stupid_questions_thread/n4jbf2t/,,,,,,

Good afternoon all. 

I‚Äôve been back training because I‚Äôm fed up of my belly and moobs üòÇ 

I started training in 2020 and was pretty consistent for around a year. Between 2021 and now I have been on and off with the gym and just not very committed as I didn‚Äôt know what route was best for me.

I‚Äôve decided I just want to be fit, with a somewhat aesthetic physique.

My plan is to continue to cut and get down to a lower body fat percentage to see what I‚Äôm working with. My question to you lovely people is, will I be skin and bone if I continue my cut or do I have enough mass there to get away with it?

When measuring the nation's collective fitness, the good news is Americans are more likely to take a brisk walk, play pickleball or lift weights.

But this year's ACSM American Fitness Index ranking of the nation's fittest cities,¬†[published](https://acsm.org/about/community-impact-programs/american-fitness-index/)¬†July 22, also found some worrisome trends. Air quality deteriorated and more people struggled to afford healthy, nutritious food.

The annual report, published by the American College of Sports Medicine and Elevance Health Foundation, ranks the nation's 100 most populous cities on personal and community health indicators. This year's report evaluated 35 indicators, including new categories like measuring trail miles, splash pads and tennis and pickleball courts.

Arlington, Virginia, ranked as the nation's fittest city for the eighth consecutive year. Washington, D.C., across the Potomac River from Arlington, ranked second. Seattle, San Francisco and Denver rounded out the top five fittest cities.

The report ranked Oklahoma City at the bottom of the list. Lubbock, Texas; North Las Vegas; Memphis, Tennessee; and Wichita, Kansas, made up the rest of the bottom five.

People can¬†[view the report](https://acsm.org/about/community-impact-programs/american-fitness-index/)¬†to see how their community fared on indicators such as public green spaces, access to parks, recreational areas, basketball hoops and bike lanes.

It boiled down to this for me: why do I do this? I do it because it helps people. It's helped me countless times and the patients I serve. Chiropractic is why my husband is no longer debilitated by intense cervicogenic headaches that rendered him bedridden for a whole day. It's still a newer profession that most people don't understand, but you can show your value by learning/honing your skills and helping people. I do it everyday and so do many other chiropractors. Are there quacks? Unfortunately, yes. Every profession has its bad apples and unfortunately we're one of the ones judged the harshest. Doesn't matter. Be great at what you do. Wow your patients. Haters will always hate, so ignore them as much as you can because they're not there to help you. I've realized that the ones criticizing the profession have either no idea what they're talking about (and choose to remain ignorant), they have massive chips on their shoulders, or they've lost their identity as a chiropractor.

n4klmpu,1m693rd,fitness,WoahItsPreston,"I don't think that this is too much for a single leg day at all. As a baseline, it should be reasonably effective, especially for your quads and glutes, which are receiving plenty of training.  It is very low however on hamstring volume, since you are only doing two sets of hamstring work in the entire workout. You also don't have a hip hinge movement, which is very important for lifting. You can add squats if you want, but you don't have to. Functionally, they are rather similar to a leg press.

If you feel like you're not seeing progress, I would check in with your diet, your consistency, your effort, and your form.

Just based on what you have written, I can find two potential issues

1. If you're doing 140 lbs on leg extensions, and you're 5'10"" 153lbs, I have a really hard time believing you are leg pressing 520 lbs for reps on a 45 degree leg press. So this could be a form thing

2. Gaining 10 lbs in 1 year is pretty slow, so maybe your diet isn't very good?

3. Maybe your expectations are too high.",2025-07-22 18:31:11+00,2,t1_n4k026r,https://reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1m693rd/daily_simple_questions_thread_july_22_2025/n4klmpu/,,,,,,

n4kpq63,1m6mko0,health,theatlantic,"‚ÄúIf you have a heart attack in the United States, you might assume that an ambulance will bring you to an ER and its staff will take care of you. But hospital closures over the past 20 years and physician shortages were undermining that assumption even before President Donald Trump signed his ‚ÄòOne Big Beautiful Bill‚Äô into law. Now that legislation‚Äîwhich will cut Medicaid spending by an estimated $1 trillion over 10 years, puts the entire emergency-medicine safety net at risk. The destabilizing effects will be felt not only by those who lose access to Medicaid, but also by those who have private health insurance.

‚ÄúAs an ER doctor in New York City, I am terrified about the coming cuts. A recent study from the Rand Corporation confirms that ERs across the entire country are dangerously overstretched and underfunded. About a fifth of emergency visits each year are never paid for, amounting to nearly $5.9 billion in care costs absorbed by hospitals. The uninsured and underinsured were already more likely to have to seek treatment in the ER when they fell ill. With the changes to Medicaid eligibility, their ranks are set to swell.

‚ÄúMedicaid provides coverage to more than 71 million Americans; in addition, the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (which provides low-cost coverage for children of families that do not qualify for Medicaid) covers 7 million children. Trump‚Äôs legislation is expected to deprive some 12 million people of Medicaid by 2034, and an additional 5 million will lose insurance because of changes to provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The cost of replacing this lost coverage for 17 million Americans will be especially daunting for low-income families: On average, health-insurance premiums add up to nearly $9,000 a year, whereas a full-time minimum-wage job generates just $15,000.

‚ÄúI went into frontline medicine to help people, not to bankrupt them‚Äîyet I am acutely aware that medical debt is a major factor in nearly three-fifths of bankruptcy cases in the United States. When someone who does not have insurance comes into the ER, I am forced to discuss with the patient what necessary care they may have to delay or forgo if they cannot afford it. These conversations will become only more frequent when millions of people are kicked off their health insurance.

Looking for some help after spinning my wheels for a bit. I used to be extremely lean and muscular, but then went off the deep end a while back because of a bad breakup, mental health issues, a cross-country move, the list could go on. I lost 20-ish pounds over several months through eating in an unhealthily low-calorie diet with very little protein while lifting. Starting in April, I started training for a 10k and decided to eat more (1400-1700 calories a day) and make sure I got sufficient protein while still lifting.

After hitting a PR in my 10k, I'm now training for a half marathon (running 4 days a week) while keeping up with lifting six times a week, and I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels. I feel absolutely skinny fat, and even though I have some visible muscle and my abs pop depending on the day, I hate the amount of fat I have all over my body. I've been at this same weight before with less fat and more muscle, and I just don't know if the answer is to eat at maintenance, cut, or bulk to achieve my aesthetic goals and my fitness goals at the same time. I also just don't know about cutting even more, as it messes with my mind and I'm not sure if I'll be happy with my body cutting 5-10 more pounds.

Does anyone have any advice on how to lean out with my volume of training? Thanks!",2025-07-22 20:12:01+00,1,t3_1m2xbuz,https://reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1m2xbuz/physique_phriday/n4l6yfi/,,,,,,

Eat 120g protein, 100-150ish grams of carbs, and keep fats lower. Start out with 1500-1800 calories a day and stay consistent. You can continue to drop this number as you see results or see the scale drop. Don‚Äôt be discouraged by the scale, it is very common to maintain weight as your body fat is replaced by muscle. Track your calories. It sounds like a chore but it‚Äôs really not hard and will ensure that you are reaching your goals. Above all else stay consistent, recover, and this should go without saying, but keep a clean diet (a few cheat meals here and there won‚Äôt hurt).

n4mzbos,1m693rd,fitness,Interr0gate,"> The chances of you losing a significant amount of muscle on a cut is basically zero, as long as you are lifting reasonably hard, don't cut too fast, and don't get too lean. So.... just don't do that. 

Ok thanks for the reassurance. I will try to not worry about my performance so much on a cut. I will just try my best. Im not cutting very hard, like 0.5-1 lbs per week. I just finished week 3.

> The goal of a cut is to lose fat. It is not to get stronger or build muscle. When you're bulking, do you sit around angry that you're gaining fat? 

Good point. Its just I hate the idea of losing muscle. I work hard to gain it, so losing it is more stressful than bulking because I'm not really at risk of ""losing"" anything by bulking, plus it feels good mentally to eat a lot more.",2025-07-23 01:50:50+00,1,t1_n4mw8ll,https://reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1m693rd/daily_simple_questions_thread_july_22_2025/n4mzbos/,,,,,,

Jesus that sounds like a lot to me hah, I guess I'm not losing that much strength/muscle then. I'm just slightly behind my bulk level by like 5-10 lbs here and there on certain exercises.

If you want PRs for the motivation, try exercises you haven't tried in a long time. If you've been cutting for a month and you last tried to PR an exercise four months ago, you had three months of gaining strength that you never measured.

n4nipw1,1m6g92y,health,zenboi92,"So one of the many scary things about the measles virus is that it actually causes immune amnesia. The virus literally destroys the immune cells that are responsible for storing prior immunity to other pathogens. Not to mention, if the person is sick for long enough, the virus makes easy way for brain infections, phenomena, or death.

Sure, natural infection creates _specific_ measles immunity, but at what cost? The damage done to the immune system, compounded with deadly symptoms of the disease, majorly outweighs the protection gained from infection.

Plus infants and children are _tiny_, which means their risk of experiencing acute fluid build-up and inflammation are more severe. It‚Äôs no bueno.

FYI, the virus that comes in the vaccine is essentially inert. The vaccine provides the natural immunity to the body without it having to get so sick and risk harming the immune system.

My daughter once told me, ‚ÄúI get why you love your work so much‚Ä¶ people come see you, they tell you how great you are, and then they happily pay you on the way out the door!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know very many other people who love their job as much as chiropractors!  Helping people improve their quality of life without drugs or surgery is so fulfilling.  

If you do choose to change course, I hope you can find something as rewarding as chiropractic!  Find a way to do what inspires you and it won‚Äôt feel like work!

I could have made this post 25 years ago. You can overcome all the above if you work at it. It will never be natural but you can learn to fake it without being fake. Before you open your own practice, become confident in your adjusting skill, this may take several years. I believe being 100% confident in adjusting is the first step and leads to success in other areas. Personally, if i had to do it over again, i would find a high volume, manual manipulation based practice to associate at for a year or two. I think you are too deep in the hole to quit at this point.

There is something to be said about the regular leg press putting pressure on your back, but it'll be front-to-back, not top-down.

n4oddb0,1m2xbuz,fitness,noseeyesears,"[32F | 5ft 3 | 52kg](https://imgur.com/a/wk7ycU1)

I got fed up of a life of being skinnyfat 2 months ago and drastically changed my habits. 

I began walking at least 4km per day, eating well with at least 120g protein per day and 1,500 calories, and working out 5-6 times per week. Mainly bodyweight exercises (I am insanely weak) and lifting with a 6kg and 8kg kettlebell. I think I‚Äôve made some big changes to my muscles in this time and my arms no longer feel like skinny twigs when tensing. 

I‚Äôve lost 1kg and am now focusing on building muscle. I‚Äôm having 1,800 calories per day (that I think is my maintenance?) and continuing to work out. I‚Äôm a little stronger, but basic bodyweight exercises are still tough for me and my kettlebells are still heavy enough to challenge me.

My husband is building a home gym in a month and I will start lifting heavy. 

Anyway, I need some guidance outside of that. Should I be cutting calories more to shed some more of my belly fat? Should I be increasing and focusing solely on building muscle? Am ok to continue what I‚Äôm doing exercise-wise now if it‚Äôs still quite challenging for me? 

Ultimately, I want to get big and strong and lower my BF percentage a little more, and I know I need to lift heavy for that long term. That‚Äôs the goal! 

Open to any questions and I‚Äôd really appreciate your advice!",2025-07-23 08:09:59+00,1,t3_1m2xbuz,https://reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1m2xbuz/physique_phriday/n4oddb0/,,,,,,

Whilst there are comments here on the idea that you can get growth even without feeling the muscle engagement, there are *also* people who *don't* get growth without feeling the muscle engagement.

>In this study, we demonstrate that golden hamsters develop persistent and late-onset neurological symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection in a model **without social or somatization influence**. We describe hamsters as a robust animal model of long COVID and provide evidence that viral and neuro-immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem, which exhibits a neurodegenerative signature characterized by an elevated innate immune response and impaired neurotransmission and energy metabolism. This model also illustrates the complexity of long COVID with clinical manifestations varying according to time, sex, and viral variants. Finally, this study highlights that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to persist in the brain and that the brainstem may act as a reservoir of infectious virus during the post-acute phases of COVID-19.",2025-07-23 08:23:09+00,1,t3_1m6iazk,https://reddit.com/r/Health/comments/1m6iazk/the_pandemic_may_have_aged_our_brains_even_before/n4oeqdn/,,,,,,
