I just had a meeting with someone from the cloud based software and it sounds like it would be an amazing switch for my business. I currently have very few problems with our current chirotouch, just would like to be able to better streamline billing and be able to login remotely. 

My husband is concerned that since this is cloud based, it will not be able to keep up with our patient load of 50-75 patients per day. He is concerned it will not be fast enough. Have any of you used this and if so, what was your experience?

1k088n0,chiropractic,Own_Database_5849,Is there anyone here that likes Chirotouch?,"I’m fairly new to practice (less than a year). I opened my own and I started with Jane because it was easier. I used chirotouch in school, but the school had it set up in a way that we couldn’t use SALT or any macros, so it was lame and it took too much time to finish a note.

Looking at the previous post that talk about chirotouch they all criticize it, and no one really share positive experiences with it. Now this is absurd since the company has not gone broke. So, why do you think people hate it? Is it because they don’t take the time to set it up correctly? They don’t have the right internet speed? Or I’m just delusional and should not change from Jane to CT?

The main reason behind the change is that they offered me a good deal and because like how the schedule looks compared to Jane, (like more organized).
Is also worth mentioning that I don’t use computers in my office but ipad pro. My main concern is how having multiple people at the same time looks on the schedule and it’s hard to select the patient’s name.

Anyway, any pointers about things to consider I have missed? I have a cash based practice, so I don’t really mess with insurance unless it’s for PI.

1m03ong,chiropractic,Electrical-Cold9950,It’s Time Chiropractors Obsessed Over a New S Word,"
Since 1895, chiropractic has centered on a single idea: the subluxation.

The concept wasn’t unreasonable for its time. Germ theory was still gaining traction, and D.D. Palmer’s belief that spinal misalignments could influence health was a creative attempt to understand disease through structure and function.

The issue isn’t that this philosophy existed. It’s that it still defines large parts of the profession today.

What began as a bold theory has become an outdated identity. Many chiropractors still rely on metaphysical language and neurological absolutes, ideas that haven’t kept pace with modern science. That matters, not just because the theory lacks evidence, but because of what that language does to patients. When someone hears their spine is out of place, or that they have the spine of an eighty-year-old, it creates fear, lowers confidence, and discourages movement.

But what if the profession known for putting motion into spines began focusing on putting more motion into people’s lives?

This isn’t a dismissal of the adjustment. Spinal manipulation has modest benefits for short-term relief of back and neck pain. It has been associated with reduced opioid use and lower overall spending on spine-related care. It is also very safe. Large-scale research has shown no greater risk of stroke after visiting a chiropractor compared to visiting a medical doctor.

The adjustment has its place. But if we want to do more than reduce pain in the short term, we need to offer more than passive care. Most people are in pain not because something is out of place, but because the demands of their life have exceeded what their body can handle. They are told to rest, they are adjusted, maybe given some ice or a few stretches, and once they start to feel better, they return to activity at the same level that got them injured in the first place.

This is where the musculoskeletal world often falls short. We are good at calming things down, but we do not always build people back up. We focus on relief, but rarely talk about how to leave someone better than they were before they got hurt.

Chiropractic likes to talk about the root cause. But if subluxation is the cause of disease, then what causes subluxation? And how can we claim to treat everything except the one thing we say is behind it all?

Maybe the real issue is not that something is out of place, but that the body is underprepared. Maybe pain is less about misalignment and more about a poor relationship with gravity. Maybe our real job is to help people restore the strength and capacity they have lost.

Which brings us to the new S word: sarcopenia.

Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. It increases the risk of falls, fractures, hospitalization, diabetes, and loss of independence. It is one of the strongest predictors of decline. And unlike subluxation, it is real, measurable, and widely studied.

The only proven intervention is exercise. Not adjustments. Not rest. Not passive care. Just progressive, consistent movement that challenges the system and builds it back up. Yet fewer than 28 percent of adults meet both aerobic and strength guidelines.

People do not just need pain relief. They need someone who can guide them, advocate for them, and coach them toward more movement, not less. Someone who helps them see that their body is not broken. It is just not ready. And it can be.

And I know what you are thinking. So now we are supposed to just pretend to be PTs and personal trainers? Partially true. But here is what I see wrong with that.

We are uniquely positioned to combat the modern health crisis. We have diagnostic skills and clinical judgment that many PTs do not. The personal training world, on the other hand, still lacks consistent oversight or formal education.

Methods are many. Principles are few.

Instead of being slaves to specific techniques or ideologies, what if we shifted focus on being servants to the people coming to us for help?These are people who do not care about egotistical inter-professional turf wars or precious philosophy. They want to get better. They deserve the best tools available within our scope, no matter which field thinks they own them. 

As B.J. Palmer once said:
“While other professions are concerned with changing the environment to suit the weakened body, chiropractic is concerned with strengthening the body to suit the environment.”

Maybe we should take him at his word.

What are your thoughts? You may disagree. But we cannot keep partying like it is 1895.

Since starting earlier this year, I’ve noticed some patterns that feel off—most treatment plans look the same, diagnosis codes are nearly identical, billing hovers around a consistent figure each visit, and documentation often feels templated or copy-pasted.

I do my best to treat each patient ethically and provide what they need, but the system in place expects consistency in scheduling, billing, and documentation that I don’t control. I’ve also tried to avoid using any scripts or pressure tactics, but they’re part of the workflow others seem to follow.

I’m just wondering—has anyone else dealt with a setup like this?
– How did you handle it early in your career?
– Did you report it, leave, or stay quiet?
– If things ever went south legally, what kind of exposure would a doc like me really have?

Post:","Hi all,

I’m starting to explore the process of selling my chiropractic practice and would really appreciate any insights or advice from those who’ve been through it — either as sellers or buyers.

We’ve built a solid patient base over 40 years and have developed a unique technique that’s central to our brand and results. One of my main questions is: what do buyers typically want during the transition period?

* Would having our current chiropractor stay on temporarily help with onboarding or patient retention?
* Do buyers usually value having the previous doctor introduce patients to the new chiropractor?
* Is it helpful or expected to provide training in our specific technique?
* How important is continuity in staff or branding to most buyers?

Basically, I want to make the transition as smooth and appealing as possible for both the buyer and our patients, while also maximizing the value of the sale.

Would love to hear from anyone who’s sold a practice, bought one, or has insight into what makes a chiropractic practice more attractive to prospective buyers.

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

Lately, I am on the side of social media that hates chiropractors and are trying to convince everyone we are quacks. I’m having a hard time because I truly love chiropractic and I’ve seen how it has changed my life. Chiropractic helped me get out of excruciating pain, and it hurts when people tell me that chiropractic is a placebo affect. I’m also having a hard time because I had a steady plan for graduating school and who I was going to work for, but that doctor recently sold his practice. The situation is really throwing me through a loop because now I feel like I’m having an identity crisis of what I truly want to specialize in.

1m667t0,chiropractic,SeraphimArchangel,"1.5 years into Chiropractic School, struggling with doubt, debt, and mental health","I’m about 1.5 years into chiropractic school (Q8), nearly $100K in debt, and lately, the pressure and uncertainty have taken a heavy toll on my mental health about whether this path is really right for me. I’ve found myself sinking into a really dark place, caught in an existential crisis that’s been hard to escape.

I got into this field because of a chiropractor I used to work with. He believed in me and showed me what this profession could be at its best. I really look up to him, and a part of me feels like I’d be letting him down if I stepped away from all of this.

I’ve also met other amazing chiropractors who are passionate, confident, and genuinely helping people. I have a lot of respect for the profession. It really is something special. But if I’m being honest with myself, I just don’t know if I see myself becoming that person.

I’m naturally more introverted, and the constant pressure to talk, build relationships, and connect with patients feels draining. I’m about to start clinic soon, and it’s hitting me how much of this career depends on those social skills. I don’t feel like I’m built for it, and that’s been really hard to sit with. Even the thought of opening up my own practice scares me.

At the same time, I’ve already put so much time and money into this. I feel stuck. I don’t even know where I’d go from here if I needed to pivot. And honestly, I feel like a failure for even thinking this way.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? How did you deal with the fear and guilt of possibly changing direction?

1m6an08,chiropractic,Low_Impress_1910,Thoughts on the legitimacy of my new Chiropractor,"Hey folks,

I figured I’d come straight to the community since I would imagine you all may be able to sniff out someone who may be taking advantage of people, as opposed to offering actual help. 

Years ago, I used to see a chiropractor, and it was actually the same one my parents went to see for many years. But after much time (and money) spent with him, I found that he was just performing a 2-3 min adjustment routine on most of not all of his patients in a very similar manner. Which is what has unfortunately caused my hesitation and doubts in ever wanting to visit one again. 

Fast forward to today, I went for an initial evaluation with a small town chiropractor in my new city, an older guy, but his first appointment with me didn’t even involve any sort of adjustments. More asking me what my core concerns were, where the pain was and offered me the free physical examination. The only thing I had to pay (with insurance) was for X-rays and a foot scan - since he could see off the bat that I lean heavily on one side and pronate badly based on my shoes. 

This in itself was a much more positive experience, but wanted to gauge the community on if this gentleman seems like he’s doing the practice justice. My only hesitation is honestly the “foot levelers” they may try to sell me on with that foot scan.
