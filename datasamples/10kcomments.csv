Researchers from Indiana University and the University of Notre Dame have discovered evidence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), commonly known as """"forever chemicals,"""" in a wide range of reusable feminine hygiene products.  [The study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00553) involved the testing of 59 products from North America, South America and Europe. These included period underwear, reusable pads, menstrual cups and reusable incontinence underwear.  Last year, researchers led from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston analyzed menstrual hygiene habits using data from the Apple Women's Health Study, which tracked 11,455 U.S. participants between November 2019 and January 2024.  Despite rising awareness about arsenic and toxic metals, regular tampons remained the most commonly used menstrual product, used by 48 percent of subjects.  Pads were used by 47 percent and panty liners by 43 percent. Among reusable options, period underwear was chosen by 20 percent and menstrual cups by 18 percent of respondents.  Recently, the researches found PFAS were detected in nearly 30 percent of the samples‚Äîat levels suggesting they were intentionally added. This marks the first official confirmation of these potentially harmful chemicals in reusable menstrual products.  """"Since reusable products are on the rise due to their increased sustainability compared to single-use products, it's important to ensure that these products are safe.

health,1m6mko0,n4kpq63,2025-07-22T18:50:25,"‚ÄúIf you have a heart attack in the United States, you might assume that an ambulance will bring you to an ER and its staff will take care of you. But hospital closures over the past 20 years and physician shortages were undermining that assumption even before President Donald Trump signed his ‚ÄòOne Big Beautiful Bill‚Äô into law. Now that legislation‚Äîwhich will cut Medicaid spending by an estimated $1 trillion over 10 years, puts the entire emergency-medicine safety net at risk. The destabilizing effects will be felt not only by those who lose access to Medicaid, but also by those who have private health insurance.  ‚ÄúAs an ER doctor in New York City, I am terrified about the coming cuts. A recent study from the Rand Corporation confirms that ERs across the entire country are dangerously overstretched and underfunded. About a fifth of emergency visits each year are never paid for, amounting to nearly $5.9 billion in care costs absorbed by hospitals. The uninsured and underinsured were already more likely to have to seek treatment in the ER when they fell ill. With the changes to Medicaid eligibility, their ranks are set to swell.  ‚ÄúMedicaid provides coverage to more than 71 million Americans; in addition, the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (which provides low-cost coverage for children of families that do not qualify for Medicaid) covers 7 million children. Trump‚Äôs legislation is expected to deprive some 12 million people of Medicaid by 2034, and an additional 5 million will lose insurance because of changes to provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The cost of replacing this lost coverage for 17 million Americans will be especially daunting for low-income families: On average, health-insurance premiums add up to nearly $9,000 a year, whereas a full-time minimum-wage job generates just $15,000.  ‚ÄúI went into frontline medicine to help people, not to bankrupt them‚Äîyet I am acutely aware that medical debt is a major factor in nearly three-fifths of bankruptcy cases in the United States. When someone who does not have insurance comes into the ER, I am forced to discuss with the patient what necessary care they may have to delay or forgo if they cannot afford it. These conversations will become only more frequent when millions of people are kicked off their health insurance.  Read more: [https://theatln.tc/woPGdyUE](https://theatln.tc/woPGdyUE)",19,False

When, for example, fast-food company Steak n‚Äô Shake announced plans to distribute Coke with cane sugar last weekend, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed, ‚ÄúMAHA is winning,‚Äù referring to the so-called Make America Healthy Again movement.

health,1m1bm6f,n3fr2rf,2025-07-16T12:44:37,"‚ÄúUntil recently, doubt about vaccines might have been seeded mainly by cautions from friends and family, or by unreliable information online. Now, though, doubt about vaccines has the weight of the federal government behind it. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has been telling the public‚Äù that ‚Äúunnecessary, unsafe vaccines have been forced on you,‚Äù Katherine J. Wu writes. ‚ÄúA recent KFF tracking survey found that about three-fourths of Republicans trust their physician to provide reliable information about vaccines‚Äîbut about three-fourths trust President Donald Trump and Kennedy to do so as well.  ‚ÄúAs those sources start to contradict one another, patients‚Äô trust in doctors‚Äîwhich was already eroding‚Äîis being pitted directly against trust in government. And in doctors‚Äô offices across the country, the Trump administration‚Äôs position is bending conversations about vaccinations‚Äîin some cases toward hesitancy, and in others toward haste as people fear that shots will soon be harder to get.‚Äù  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ The government‚Äôs alterations to vaccine guidance so far have been relatively limited. But Kennedy and many of his allies have criticized the immunization schedule, especially for kids, or advocated for paring it back further. And according to nearly a dozen doctors I spoke with, plenty of patients have already picked up on the spirit of these changes: that they should put less stock in vaccination than the government had previously called for.  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Families who remain eager to vaccinate are also taking seriously Kennedy‚Äôs rhetoric‚Äîand the implication that a government that endorses fewer shots will ultimately depress their availability.

health,1lxzwc3,n2pzdga,2025-07-12T13:00:45,"Lucy Tu: ‚ÄúFor decades, reproductive care in the United States has been considered a women‚Äôs issue. Among heterosexual couples struggling to conceive, infertility is roughly as likely to stem from male factors as from female ones. Yet in up to 25 percent of infertility cases, the male partner is never evaluated. Male infertility can sometimes be treated with hormone therapy or surgical correction of physical blockages. But male-infertility care is less likely to be included in state insurance laws than female treatments such as IVF. Plus, in most cases, ‚Äòyou can bypass male-infertility problems by just treating the woman more aggressively, even if she doesn‚Äôt have fertility issues herself,‚Äô Peter Schlegel, a urologist and male-infertility specialist who runs New York Men‚Äôs Health Medical, told me. According to CDC data, approximately one in six IVF cycles is initiated solely due to male infertility.  ‚ÄúThat means women disproportionately bear the medical and emotional demands of fertility treatment. IVF typically requires women to undergo daily hormone injections and invasive procedures. Hormone treatments can cause nausea, mood swings, bloating, and bruising at the injection site. Egg retrieval typically involves anesthesia, at least 24 hours of rest after, and days of recovery for lingering symptoms. Most people who use IVF need multiple cycles to conceive, and recent research has raised concerns about possible long-term health consequences from repeated treatments, including elevated cancer risks.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no wonder, then, that patients and policy makers have been looking for alternatives to IVF. The Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank that opposes abortion and has described the American IVF industry as the ‚ÄòWild West,‚Äô has called for the U.S. government to embrace restorative reproductive medicine, or RRM. This model, which originated in the 1970s as a natural family-planning method, focuses on identifying and treating what proponents call the ‚Äòroot causes‚Äô of infertility, including hormonal imbalances and diseases such as endometriosis; IVF is a last resort. Some vocal RRM proponents reject the procedure outright, arguing that it treats embryos as commodities and women as vessels, subjecting them to expensive, dehumanizing procedures.  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Even so, RRM often requires women to engage in meticulous cycle tracking and hormone monitoring, leaving them to shoulder the ongoing work of managing and measuring their biology in service of pregnancy. This emphasis on women‚Äôs bodies and behaviors is especially conspicuous amid a broader cultural preoccupation with male virility.¬†  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ And yet, for all the public hand-wringing over male infertility, medical treatments for it remain absent from policy conversations.‚Äù  Read more: [https://theatln.tc/xA1xT8w7](https://theatln.tc/xA1xT8w7)¬†",2,False

In 2023, fatal overdoses dropped for the first time in five years. In 2024, they fell 24% from the previous year. A report from early 2025 showed that fatal fentanyl overdoses had gone down in every single state and the District of Columbia. It seemed that the nation was finally turning a corner after years of ever-worsening news from this ‚Äúmodern plague.‚Äù  But rather than capitalize on what experts have called ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù and ‚Äúvery, very exciting‚Äù trends, the Trump administration has spread misinformation, cut key funding and dismantled some of the most effective tools for preventing overdose deaths. Now it appears the U.S. may be backsliding, with the latest blow coming from a bill Trump signed on the Fourth of July.

Historically foreign manufacturers were notified of inspections in advance, which had the negative aspect of enabling advance time to hide objectionable records, but had the positive aspect of cooperation of the firm to be inspected with the travel details. The current situation places additional burden on the investigators to schedule travel and lodging details halfway around the world, potentially to be told that the plant is """"closed for maintenance"""" after they arrive.      2. A previous ProPublica article highlighted FDA's """"enforcement discretion"""" policy in which foreign firms who had failed previous inspections and were placed on the agency's Import Alert List were granted dispensation to export selected drug shortage products to the US.

Here, we show impaired glycogen metabolism in the brain of a tauopathy Drosophila melanogaster model and people with AD, indicating a link between tauopathies and glycogen metabolism. We demonstrate that the breakdown of neuronal glycogen ameliorates the tauopathy phenotypes in flies and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from people with FTLD-tau. Glycogen breakdown redirects glucose flux to the pentose phosphate pathway and alleviates oxidative stress. Our findings uncover a critical role for the neuroprotective effects of dietary restriction (DR) by increasing glycogen breakdown. Mechanistically, we show a potential interaction between tau protein and glycogen, suggesting a vicious cycle in which tau binding promotes glycogen accumulation in neurons, which in turn exacerbates tau accumulation which further disrupts cellular homeostasis. Our studies identify impaired glycogen metabolism as a key hallmark for tauopathies and offer a promising therapeutic target in tauopathy and other neurodegenerative diseases.",1,False

To their surprise, the worst effects didn‚Äôt show up immediately, despite the heavy dose of smoke. Instead, people‚Äôs lung function seemed to deteriorate later. Right after the fires, about 10 percent of the cohort had lung function that fell below the lower limit of normal. By the one-year mark, about 46 percent did. At the two-year mark, most of those people still had abnormally poor lung function.¬†  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Migliaccio‚Äôs work can speak to only a single smoke event. But it is the type of event that more people in the United States are dealing with, over and over again. Until recently, wildfires that exposed large populations to smoke were a relatively rare occurrence. But that‚Äôs changing: More frequent and intense wildfires are erasing or even reversing decades of gains made in American air quality in the majority of U.S. states. Across the country, from 2012 to 2022, the number of people exposed to unhealthy air from wildfire smoke increased 27-fold; one out of every four unhealthy air days in parts of the country is now a smoke day. ‚ÄòIt is the exposure that is impacting air quality across the U.S. now more than any other pollution source,‚Äô Joan Casey, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Washington whose work helped show a link between wildfire-smoke exposure and increased risk of dementia, told me.  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Plenty of research shows that respiratory distress and heart attacks spike in the event of smoke exposure; acute impacts of breathing smoke send people to the hospital and make them miss work and school. Those risks can linger for months afterward, or, in the case of the Seeley Lake cohort, for years.  ‚ÄúNow that more people are regularly breathing smoky air over their lifetime, though, the relevant concern may no longer be what happens when a person gets one big dose of smoke; rather, it may be what happens when they are exposed many times. How much does anyone know about the long-term consequences of exposure to smoke or, worse, the long-term consequences of long-term exposure to smoke? ‚ÄòVery little,‚Äô Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou, an environmental engineer and epidemiologist at‚Äîas of next week‚ÄîBrown University, told me.‚Äù  Read more: [https://theatln.tc/pyeRsB5v](https://theatln.tc/pyeRsB5v)¬†",48,False

Global vaccination work has nearly halved the global infant-mortality rate, saved more than 150 million lives, prevented innumerable costly hospitalizations and long-term disabilities, and strengthened local health services in many remote places. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine a more successful, cost-effective public-health organization than the Gavi alliance,‚Äù a pediatrician and vaccine researcher said.¬†  In the United States, we‚Äôre somewhat blinkered about what vaccination means to the other 96 per cent of people in the world. On Wednesday, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., announced that the U.S. intends to withhold the amount that the Biden Administration had pledged to Gavi, $1.6 billion. He claimed that Gavi had ‚Äúignored the science‚Äù about vaccine safety. He had already dismissed all 17 members of the C.D.C.‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, before saying that his hand-picked replacements would review the U.S. childhood-immunization schedule.  ¬†An enormous amount of energy has gone into grossly misleading ‚Äúdebates‚Äù about vaccine safety and effectiveness.

But there was also a political problem: The reform law known as ‚ÄúObamacare‚Äù was not at all popular at the time.  It was difficult to imagine 14 years ago that two-thirds of the public would express support for the ACA, but Democratic leaders who swore that its popularity would grow over time were correct.

A chemical preservative that stamps out contamination in vaccine vials, thimerosal was removed from most U.S. shots more than two decades ago over worries that its mercury content could trigger developmental delays. But those concerns‚Äîas well as baseless claims that thimerosal causes autism‚Äîhave been proved unfounded, many times over. ‚ÄòWe took care of this 20 years ago,‚Äô Kathryn Edwards, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University, told me.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how anti-vaccine activists see the compound. Even the strongest data supporting thimerosal‚Äôs safety have not quelled the concerns of those who insist on the chemical‚Äôs harms. And now the CDC‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, has signaled that thimerosal‚Äôs presence in vaccines should remain open for debate. The panel is scheduled on Thursday to discuss the compound, which is present in a minority of flu shots in low or trace amounts, and vote on how vaccines containing it should be used.  ‚ÄúThe panel that will meet this week is more skeptical of vaccines than any version in ACIP history. Earlier this month, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly dismissed all 17 existing members of the panel‚Äîamong them, some of the nation‚Äôs foremost experts in vaccinology, infectious disease, pediatrics, and public health‚Äîand replaced them with eight new members who largely lack expertise in vaccines and, in several cases, have espoused anti-vaccine viewpoints. This new panel will hear a presentation on thimerosal not from a career vaccine scientist‚Äîas is usual ACIP practice‚Äîbut from Lyn Redwood, one of the first vocal advocates of the false notion that thimerosal causes autism and the former president of Children‚Äôs Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization that Kennedy chaired until 2023.  ‚ÄúACIP‚Äôs charter is to evaluate the data and guide the country‚Äôs approach to vaccines. By reopening the case on thimerosal, Kennedy‚Äôs handpicked committee has already chosen to entertain a classic anti-vaccine talking point. If the new ACIP‚Äôs vote further limits the use of vaccines containing the compound, it will also show, from the get-go, how willing it is to disregard evidence.‚Äù  Read more: [https://theatln.tc/FjPPDwOg](https://theatln.tc/FjPPDwOg)¬†",23,False

I read about this on an FB group and read through the thread of cannabis users insulted that such a study should be featured on a social media site and cluelessly acting as if they understand what the research paper actually says and how to actually read a clinical research paper.   Here is the deal: The findings mean that a high association was found between cannabis and heart disease after *retrospectively* reviewing 12 studies inclusive of *200 million people* (an extremely large study group--which goes toward legitimacy of the findings).  This is called a retrospective literature review study. The methodology of the different studies were different so direct parallels about demographics and cannabis use (type, frequency) could not be made. This info needs to be noted as a limitation in the present study, which it was. (Legit research papers in general have to include a section on study limitations). The present study is an aggregate of findings--cumulative evidence--based on 12 studies and 200 million people--that found a *strong association. Association is not the same as causation, and the study authors noted this in good faith.*   The study included info on inclusion and exclusion criteria regarding the studies themselves to find studies that had the best methodology for analysis. And, no, there are not a lot of studies out there yet that look at cannabis and heart disease. Some European countries collect every iota of citizen medical data into a research database and crunch the data for patterns--and some of the data in this study likely reflect that (and is why the study population is so big).  These types of retrospective """"literature review"""" studies (for any medical topic) are a *starting point* for finding potential patterns and outcomes that then become the basis for other *\*prospective\** studies using more standardized, parallel methods across studies to make further discoveries regarding association and causation that can eventually lead to healthcare policy.  Just because you do not like the findings doesn't mean they are spurious. At this point, even though the findings are drawn from a huge study population, it doesn't mean that they are set in stone either. The findings definitely are cause for further research, though.",5,False

I work in acute healthcare and  have a lot of experience with protein requirements.  With respect I never suggested it was 'just activity'. I said lifestyle change which covers a range of factors.

I will however continue to question that amount of protein at over 2.2g/kg (we work in metric, so that makes more sense to me than 'just over 1g/lb').  2.2g/kg may be standard in an 'active community' but does not mean it is at all necessary or evidenced, or safe for all members of that community.   We use evidenced standard reference ranges for protein and other nutrients depending on body mass, sex, age, acute condition/disease state. Assuming you're in the US, I presume your mother uses equivalent evidenced ranges there.   The above is more than the vast majority in an 'active community' needs unless that community is body building, and should not be promoted to the general public.  **Edit to add a reference point:** Severe burns/tissue trauma and unhealing surgical wounds require up to 2.0-2.2g/kg for positive outcomes, with more than that unlikely utilised by the body (in that state at least). The general public, incl. 'sporty'/athletic, do not require that amount to maintain their already healthy muscle, or to build it: they are not regenerating 50% of their skin after a gas explosion for example, or muscle, skin and tissue for a degloved leg after an RTA.

Alcohol triggers endorphin release which activates opioid receptors. Naltrexone blocks that pathway, so you feel less pleasure from drinking.  Speaking from experience, since I've been on it I've gone from having an alcohol dependency to not having one at all. I rarely ever drink, and if I do I don't drink much at all (because when you don't get no pleasure, it's just a waste of calories at a certain point).  Added benefit(?) - since it blocks pleasure from things which release endorphins, I've also stopped vaping completely, and now only drink ¬Ω a cup of coffee a day, oddly. I'm actually kind of sad about the coffee tbh because I have always loved coffee. It's also prescribed for people with binge eating disorder to reduce cravings and the rewarding effects of food. Oh, and to people who have opioid use disorder too.   Some people take it just routinely daily in the morning or night, usually as prescribed. Some people take it right before they drink, and they find that to be more successful. Just an FYI, because I would want to know that. There's a /r/naltrexone sub as well, where that method (the Sinclair method, I believe) is quite popular.   Lastly (this is a general warning, not implying you specifically), before anyone takes naltrexone, make sure you are **fully detoxed** (off opioids for 7‚Äì10 days), or you can immediately have severe withdrawal.",3,False

health,1lijdwz,mzkmlqs,2025-06-24T20:01:39,"Puckering, puffing, scrunching and stretching your face may look silly, but in some spaces, it‚Äôs the serious business of face yoga.  The trendy facial workout involves a series of exaggerated poses and repetitive movements meant to target the muscles in the face, trading full-bodied yoga moves such as ‚Äúdownward dog‚Äù for the lip-pouting ‚Äúduckface‚Äù and other expressions.  Popular for being both cost-effective and product-free, face yoga testimonies can be found all over social media, with some influencers and self-proclaimed gurus promising a ‚Äúnatural facelift‚Äù effect capable of toning, slimming and reducing fine lines on the face.  But how much are these promised benefits a stretch of the truth? And how much is backed by science?  Here‚Äôs what a yoga instructor, a dermatologist and the author of one of the few face yoga studies out there have to say.   The science behind face yoga  The face is made up of layers of skin, fat and muscle sitting on top of the skull.  Underneath the top layer of skin, or dermis, there is a layer of subcutaneous fat pads, which sit on top of the muscles, explained Dr. Anetta Reszko, a New York-based dermatologist and clinical assistant professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. These muscles help us smile, frown, chew and make other facial expressions.  ‚ÄúThe fat and the muscles work together to give the face volume,‚Äù Reszko said. ‚ÄúBut over time, as we age, or if we don‚Äôt use those muscles because of Botox, they can atrophy (and) become smaller.‚Äù  This atrophy can cause the fat pads on top of the muscles to fall, giving the face a more sagging or hollow appearance, Reszko said.  ‚ÄúThe idea behind facial yoga is you‚Äôre working below that level, growing the muscle layer below the fat,‚Äù said Dr. Murad Alam, the vice chair of the department of dermatology and professor at Northwestern University‚Äôs Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. ‚ÄúAs you grow the muscle, that would restore some shape to the face.‚Äù  Alam, who is also a practicing dermatologist, conducted one of the few known studies to test this face yoga hypothesis in 2018 on a small cohort of middle-aged adults.  After 20 weeks of daily, 30-minute exercises, a panel of dermatologists observed improved facial fullness among the 16 participants who completed the program, the study reported.  ‚ÄúThe place where we noticed the biggest change was the cheeks,‚Äù Alam said. ‚ÄúWhich makes sense, because the cheek muscles are among the biggest facial muscles, so if you exercise them, the growth of them is going to be the most noticeable.‚Äù  Due to the limited sample size and lack of direct measurements, further clinical trials would be needed to affirm this volumizing effect, Alam noted. Generally, medical research without a drug or device is difficult to fund, he said.  ‚ÄúIs this a replacement for cosmetic procedures? Not really, because the amount of improvement was not as significant and (other cosmetic) aspects of aging weren‚Äôt studied,‚Äù Alam said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs potentially useful to people who absolutely do not want any cosmetic procedures because they‚Äôre concerned about the safety or the cost or the inconvenience.‚Äù  What else could face yoga do?  In Reszko‚Äôs dermatology practice, she recommends face yoga exercises for increasing blood and lymphatic fluid circulation in the face.  Our faces have hundreds of lymph nodes that use fluid to drain waste and fight infection, Reszko said. During sleep, lymphatic fluid can accumulate in the face from lying down, causing a ‚Äúpuffy‚Äù appearance immediately upon waking.  Moving, stretching and massaging the face for 10 to 15 minutes every day could help reduce puffiness, Reszko said, referencing other techniques such the traditional Chinese gua sha stones that are meant to serve a similar purpose. This drainage can be especially helpful for patients who recently underwent cosmetic surgery or those with chronic allergies, she said.  Increasing blood flow to the face may also make the skin appear more flushed and hydrated as well, Reszko said, but this effect is usually temporary.  If you tend to hold tension in your neck, shoulders, jaw, forehead or anywhere else on the face, face yoga also could be helpful to relax the muscles, said Annelise Hagen, a yoga instructor and self-proclaimed pioneer of the technique who authored the book ‚ÄúThe Yoga Face.‚Äù  ‚ÄúTension is a huge enemy for a lot of us. We are making these faces without realizing it all the time.‚Äù Hagen said. ‚ÄúA lot of the work I do is just trying to teach people how to notice and be more mindful, relax and take a breath.‚Äù  For Hagen, face yoga is more than just a workout or a cosmetic bio-hack ‚Äî it‚Äôs a way to be more in tune with your face.  In her classes, she may encourage people to lift the corners of their mouth for a neutral, ‚Äúsmiling Buddha face.‚Äù Or for the neck and jaw, she‚Äôll do the ‚Äúlion‚Äôs breath,‚Äù opening her mouth wide, sticking out her tongue, rolling back her eyes and exhaling.  ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre approaching the face from a yogic perspective, it‚Äôs about being mindful of what we do with the face and acknowledging that it‚Äôs kind of a manifestation of something inside,‚Äù Hagen said. ‚ÄúSome people may approach it differently, but anything that can make you feel more serene, calm and better about the face that you‚Äôre in, I think is legitimate.‚Äù  Can face yoga be harmful?  Generally, face yoga exercises are harmless, Alam said. To cause wrinkling, frown lines, bruising or other trauma to the face, a person would have to apply painful force.  On the other hand, if someone is serious about taking up a daily face yoga routine, Reszko suggests avoiding movements that rub or stretch the delicate under-eye area. The skin around the eyes tends to be thinner and more sensitive than the rest of the face.  For more dramatic interventions like firming wrinkles or treating acne, she recommends seeking the advice of a board-certified dermatologist.",3,False

But when I was filing her Tax Return for '24, we were notified that actually her income doesn't qualify her for APTC so we gotta give the money back. It was very worrying for us, but then we just had to pay back $700. That's the amount you gotta payback even if you're not eligible for APTC when you're in the lower income bracket.  This year her eligibility was again denied, as she's married but filing separately - cause you know what I have never been to the USA, waiting for years for my Visa. Still she was denied saying she's ineligible, cause filing separately. We sorted that out after contacting them and waiting for over a month after confirming that I am not in the USA, and never have been and so far not subjected to file taxes in the USA. Filed again - again ineligible for APTC and the premium for this year will be $600+ for the lowest plan with shitty coverage. The system just says, you better apply for Medicaid, and as you're eligible for Medicaid you won't be able to get any APTC.  But she's in Texas, and last time I applied for her Medicaid - they just point-blank told her - you're not eligible, you can reapply but actually will not be accepted cause chances are very, very low.  So tell me, what should I do? Won't get APTC cause marketplace says your income is low enough to be eligible for Medicaid, go and do that - we'll even point you towards that direction.

health,1lge89o,myw5w8o,2025-06-20T22:34:47,"A couple things to unpack here from a physician - first as well this is very sad, no court has reviewed the facts and actually determined if malpractice occurred yet. It is very important to get the actual timeline and medical data before jumping to conclusions because these situations are often very complicated, and it‚Äôs very hard to determine if malpractice occurred with without objective data.  The woman requesting a C-section certainly sounds challenging. While we try to take the best care of our patients possible we do not routinely offer C-sections for first time births unless there is a medical reason to do so. Medical reasons to do so would be something that is happening during the delivery that poses an unacceptable risk to either the mother or the baby. Because of the nature of childbirth, which is very complex, sometimes things go from completely stable to suddenly the baby is in distress very quickly. In these cases the decision to perform a C-section is made on the spot. Making that decision early exposes the mother and the baby to unnecessary risks and harm associated with a big surgery.  The other thing to look at is the delivery method, specifically pulling on the babies head. While fetal decapitation is incredibly sad, it does unfortunately happen sometimes. Using forceps or a vacuum to assist in the delivery of a baby is very common and has been for hundreds of years. It has become even more popular recently as obesity in the American population has increased, leading to larger babies which tend to get stuck in the birth canal. Now the worst case scenario would be if they use the forceps to pull on the head of a live baby with so much force that the head was decapitated. This is certainly possible, and would be awful, but there are also other explanations. When babies get stuck, they tend to get very sick very quickly. It is uncommon, but not unheard of for the baby to die while stuck in the birth canal. If the baby is dead and unable to be safely removed from the birth canal and the next step is often to perform a decapitation in order to allow the babies head and then body to be evacuated, saving the life of the mother.  I‚Äôm not saying what happened in this case, because I was not the doctor, and without medical records, showing things like vital signs and fetal heart rate monitoring to know when exactly the baby began to experience distress, and when the baby died, it is impossible to know if the physician making these decisions in real time made the right move or not. It is incredibly sad nonetheless, and clearly the hospital behaved unscrupulously and trying to hide the details from the mother. They should be punished for that. But people should also be aware that there is quite a bit going on in a case like this, and it is not by definition malpractice, or some evil doctor trying to kill a woman‚Äôs baby out of malice",63,False

This must be stopped.  ‚ÄúTo this end, the companies market the continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, a quarter-size sensor that takes a near-constant measure of the glucose in the fluid between a person‚Äôs cells. Once inserted into an arm, the sensor allows the wearer to monitor their blood-sugar levels on a phone app for $80 to $184 a month. Doing so allows you to ‚Äòsee the impact of what you eat‚Äô (according to the start-up Lingo), to ‚Äòmotivate behavior change and encourage healthier choices‚Äô (according to another called Levels), and to ‚Äòpersonalize your approach‚Äô to weight loss, because ‚Äòeveryone‚Äôs journey is different‚Äô (according to Nutrisense).  ‚ÄúThe gadgets have been revolutionary for many people with diabetes‚Äîpreviously the main available device for measuring blood sugar required users to prick their fingers multiple times a day. Many insurers cover CGM prescriptions for diabetics; they can pick up the devices at the pharmacy just as they would blood-test strips. But when I asked a half dozen experts whether people who don‚Äôt have diabetes should wear CGMs, I got a resounding ‚ÄòMeh.‚Äô ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a free country. People can pay money for whatever they feel like doing,‚Äô David Nathan, a diabetes expert at Harvard, told me. ‚ÄòBut from a medical point of view, I am personally unconvinced that they lead to any health benefit.‚Äô  ‚ÄúRelying on a Harvard diabetes expert to give you diabetes advice, however, goes against the general ethos of the ‚ÄòMake America Healthy Again‚Äô movement, many of whose members have been heavily promoting CGMs in recent months, including to people who don‚Äôt have diabetes.‚Äù  Read more: [https://theatln.tc/Nnwcrgdx](https://theatln.tc/Nnwcrgdx)¬†",6,False

First, cannabis exposure was poorly reported in the included studies, which prevented our meta-analysis from assessing it. Second, a significant portion of included studies was at moderate to high risk of bias, primarily due to a lack of information regarding missing data. Concerns were also raised about the risk of misclassification of exposure, particularly in studies from medical databases, which have a low sensitivity for non-medical drug use. Studies that relied on patient surveys faced substantial bias regarding exposure and outcome misclassification when patients assessed these data themselves. Furthermore, most included studies (n=19) were cross-sectional, a design providing a poor level of evidence unable to establish the causal link between outcome and exposure.‚Äù  ***if you reference the chart they provide the ‚Äúexposure‚Äù level for each article and several of the studies that they used in the meta analysis are from either diagnostic codes from medical charts or asking ‚Äúhave you ever used marijuana?‚Äù.

So this is actually something that increases the risk of a cardiovascular accident and could potentially have long term effects, but not something that you could feel at the moment nor remotely similar to what you are describing, which is basically an anxiety attack (something that certainly could be also related with use of cannabis but hard to measure accurately for obvious reasons).  Aside from that, I agree with the user you are responding to: population for this study is small (only 55 people in total, of which only 9 are THC-edible users).   And regardless of this topic in particular or any other, also in different fields of scientific research, it's a fact that non-experts (mainly mainstream media) tend to misunderstand and overrepresent the importance of individual studies.  This doesn't mean the study is bad, it's just limited in its scope.   Sometimes, mainstream media reports the results of individual studies as if they had found a universal unquestionable truth, and that doesn't work like that.   Scientific studies give statistical approximations to the truth and it's the accumulation of evidence and reproducibility of similar results from past studies what eventually allows scientists to reach a consensus on something.

Less alveoli is less oxygen/co2 exchange with blood per heart beat, so the heart has to beat harder/faster to compensate for decreased efficiency, which can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension, which makes your heart work even harder, which can lead to an enlarged heart, and congestive heart failure.

In this interview with Yahoo Life‚Äôs Rachel Grumman Bender, Hofmann explains why IUDs can be painful for some, why any fears shouldn‚Äôt scare people off from getting this highly effective contraceptive and how these pain management guidelines are an important step in the right direction.*  IUDs are really one of the most effective birth control methods out there. We call them¬†[LARCs](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/long-acting-reversible-contraception-iud-and-implant), or long-acting reversible contraceptives.¬†[Hormonal IUDs](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/hormonal-iud-mirena)¬†are¬†[over 99% effective](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/how-effective-are-iuds)¬†at preventing pregnancy, and¬†[nonhormonal IUDs](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/non-hormonal-copper-iud)¬†are equally effective. What‚Äôs nice about hormonal IUDs is that we also use them to manage a lot of gynecologic conditions, such as heavy menstrual bleeding and painful periods.  However, patients are coming to us and saying, ‚ÄúI do not want to have this horrible experience with getting an IUD. How can we manage this?‚Äù I‚Äôve been in practice for a little over 20 years and \[when I started out\], we would tell people to take some ibuprofen beforehand and try to do some distraction techniques while we‚Äôre putting it in. There‚Äôs a lot of grin and bear it in gynecology and in women‚Äôs health.  It‚Äôs really challenging for us as providers to give people an accurate assessment of what they‚Äôre going to experience with IUD placement. I‚Äôve seen people who have had IUDs placed where it was like,¬†*That was not terrible,*¬†and then all the way to¬†*That was the worst pain that I‚Äôve ever had in my entire life and I had a natural childbirth*. There‚Äôs a very large range of how people experience pain as well as anxiety.  So I think as a provider, the guidelines really put the onus on us to help people anticipate the pain and have that conversation about what they can expect. Sometimes they won‚Äôt know until they‚Äôre in the throes of it, and so it‚Äôs about being prepared with some pain options in anticipation that it could be a really painful and uncomfortable procedure for them.

And thus, concentrate was born.    Now, as orange supplies suffer from greening disease, the flavor and fragrance industry is developing workarounds to keep the taste of bottled juice consistent.

Unlike younger generations, they have largely been able to walk a straightforward path toward prosperity, security, and power. They were born in an era of unprecedented economic growth and stability. College was affordable, and they graduated in a thriving job market. They were the first generation to reap the full benefits of a golden age of medical innovations: birth control, robotic surgery, the mapping of the human genome, effective cancer treatments, Ozempic.  ‚ÄúBut recent policy changes are poised to make life significantly harder for Baby Boomers. ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre in your 60s or 70s, what the Trump administration has done means more insecurity for your assets in your 401(k), more insecurity about sources of long-term care, and, for the first time, insecurity about your Social Security benefits,‚Äô Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at the New School, told me. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a triple threat.‚Äô After more than half a century of aging into political and economic trends that worked to their benefit, the generation has become particularly vulnerable at exactly the wrong moment in history.  ‚ÄúPerhaps the biggest threat to Boomers in the second Trump administration is an overhaul of Social Security, which provides benefits to nearly nine out of 10 Americans ages 65 and older.¬†  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ In the near future, older Americans might find themselves paying more for medical care too. Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòbig, beautiful bill,‚Äô which has passed in the House but awaits a vote in the Senate, would substantially limit Medicare access for many documented immigrants, including seniors who have paid taxes in the United States for years. The bill would also reduce Medicaid enrollment by about 10.3 million people. Although Medicaid is for people with limited incomes of all ages, it supports many older Americans and pays for more than half of long-term care in the U.S. Most seniors require some sort of nursing home or at-home medical care; one study found that 70 percent of adults who live to 65 will require long-term services and support.  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ The unknowability of the future has always been a scary part of getting older. The enormous upheaval that the Trump administration has created will only magnify that uncertainty for Boomers. After a historical arc of good fortune, their golden generation has to contend with bad timing.‚Äù  Read more: [https://theatln.tc/RsTPDYEl](https://theatln.tc/RsTPDYEl)¬†",161,False

health,1lbddvp,mxrn9n4,2025-06-14T16:56:50,"Nicholas Florko: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to forget that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‚Äôs assault on vaccines‚Äîincluding, most recently, his gutting of the expert committee that guides American vaccine policy‚Äîmight have been avoided. Four months ago, his nomination for health secretary was in serious jeopardy. The deciding vote seemed to be in the hands of one Republican senator: Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. A physician who gained prominence by vaccinating low-income kids in his home state, Cassidy was wary of the longtime vaccine conspiracist. ‚ÄòI have been struggling with your nomination,‚Äô he told Kennedy during his confirmation hearings in January.  ‚ÄúIn the speech he gave on the Senate floor explaining his decision, Cassidy said that he‚Äôd vote to confirm Kennedy only because he had extracted a number of concessions from the nominee‚Äîchief among them that he would preserve, ‚Äòwithout changes,‚Äô the very CDC committee Kennedy overhauled this week. Since then, Cassidy has continued to give Kennedy the benefit of the doubt. On Monday, after Kennedy dismissed all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee, Cassidy posted on X that he was working with Kennedy to prevent the open roles from being filled with ‚Äúpeople who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe senator has failed, undeniably and spectacularly. One new appointee, Robert Malone, has repeatedly spread misinformation (or what he prefers to call ‚Äòscientific dissent‚Äô) about vaccines. Another appointee, Vicky Pebsworth, is on the board of an anti-vax nonprofit, the National Vaccine Information Center. Cassidy may keep insisting that he is doing all he can to stand up for vaccines. But he already had his big chance to do so, and he blew it. Now, with the rest of America, he‚Äôs watching the nation‚Äôs vaccine future take a nosedive.  ‚ÄúSo far, the senator hasn‚Äôt appeared interested in any kind of mea culpa for his faith in Kennedy‚Äôs promises. On Thursday, I caught Cassidy as he hurried out of a congressional hearing room. He was still reviewing the appointees, he told me and several other reporters who gathered around him. When I chased after him down the hallway to ask more questions, he told me, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll be putting out statements, and I‚Äôll let those statements stand for themselves.‚Äô A member of his staff dismissed me with a curt ‚ÄòThank you, sir.‚Äô Cassidy‚Äôs staff has declined repeated requests for an interview with the senator since the confirmation vote in January.  ‚ÄúWith the exception of Mitch McConnell, every GOP senator voted to confirm Kennedy. They all have to own the health secretary‚Äôs actions. But Cassidy seemed to be the Republican most concerned about Kennedy‚Äôs nomination, and there was a good reason to think that the doctor would vote his conscience. In 2021, Cassidy was one of seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Donald Trump on an impeachment charge after the insurrection at the Capitol. But this time, the senator‚Äîwho is up for reelection next year, facing a more MAGA-friendly challenger‚Äîultimately fell in line.‚Äù  Read more: [https://theatln.tc/tBBfK360](https://theatln.tc/tBBfK360)¬†",34,False

health,1l99ma5,mxay1lm,2025-06-12T01:12:11,"For years, food has been seen as a¬†key way¬†people are exposed to PFAS, a group of long-lasting chemicals found in everything from industrial materials to everyday consumer products. These ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù are known to linger in the environment and have been linked to serious health risks. But there‚Äôs encouraging news.  A new study from researchers at the¬†Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH)¬†finds that PFAS exposure through food has actually declined among adults over the past 20 years. However, the study also highlights that drinking water is still a significant source of PFAS exposure.  Published in the journal¬†Environmental Science & Technology, the research looked at how diet and drinking water relate to blood levels of ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù PFAS‚Äîolder chemicals that were phased out in the United States in the early 2000s. The team analyzed blood samples from California residents and found that PFAS exposure was linked to eating seafood, eggs, and brown rice. Surprisingly, they found fewer food-related connections than earlier studies suggested.  The researchers also discovered that people living in areas with detectable PFAS in their tap water had higher levels of the chemicals in their blood. However, these levels were lower than those found in severely contaminated regions.  Regulatory Context and Public Health Implications  The findings published the same day the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)¬†announced¬†that it will roll back first-ever limits on certain types of PFAS in drinking water, set last year. The EPA also said it will uphold drinking water standards for two of the most harmful forever chemicals‚ÄîPFOA and PFOS‚Äîbut extended the deadline for water utilities‚Äô compliance with these rules, from 2029 to 2031.  The study provides the first analysis of the effects of diet and drinking water simultaneously on PFAS concentrations in blood, and it fills a critical gap in research on this topic. Most US information on PFAS in food relies on earlier European studies that cannot be fully applied to the US population or lifestyle due to differences in time of sampling, diet, food production, and industries. To understand and mitigate the harmful effects of PFAS on individuals and the environment, the US needs current data on the possible contributing sources of exposure.  While we observed fewer dietary associations compared to previous studies, diet and water may still be an important source of exposure in the general population,‚Äù says study lead and corresponding author Dr. Emily Pennoyer, a graduate of BUSPH‚Äôs environmental health PhD program, and a student at the time of the study. ‚ÄúThese findings emphasize the need to continue ongoing efforts to regulate PFAS in drinking water.‚Äù  Known as ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù because they are difficult to break down, some PFAS are¬†linked¬†to a number of diseases and other health conditions, including multiple cancers, liver damage, thyroid disease, decreased vaccine response, and developmental and reproductive complications.  Shifts in Dietary PFAS Exposure  For the study, Dr. Pennoyer and colleagues at BUSPH, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and California Department of Toxic Substances Control estimated associations among legacy serum PFAS concentrations, self-reported food consumption, and PFAS concentrations in public drinking water supplies. The 700 adult participants were selected from the¬†California Regional Exposure Study, conducted from¬†2018-2020, which measures and compares environmental chemicals in people across the state to better understand how to reduce chemical exposure and improve public health.  The participants provided survey responses detailing demographic information and the frequency in which they consume red meat, poultry, seafood, dairy, eggs, potatoes, brown rice, takeout, and packaged foods that are heated at home. The researchers observed associations between legacy serum PFAS and consumption of seafood, eggs and brown rice, but overall, PFAS exposure through food appeared to be lower than earlier studies in other populations‚Äîa surprising result to the team. This decline could be due, in part, to the Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs decision to phase out legacy PFAS from manufacturing, and¬†restrict¬†certain PFAS in paper food contact materials.  ‚ÄúIt is encouraging that we see fewer associations with food in this study, but concern about PFAS in some food groups remain,‚Äù says study coauthor Dr. Nerissa Wu, biomonitoring California program lead at CDPH. ‚ÄúWe will continue to work to understand how to lower PFAS levels in the California food supply.‚Äù",8,False

From what I read though this seems positive despite the tone of the article implying it to be negative.  >For example, atlas-based analysis revealed a 19% increase in the volume of the middle frontal gyrus among those clocking up long working hours compared with those working standard hours.  >This part of the brain has a major role in various cognitive functions, particularly in the frontal lobe. It‚Äôs involved in attention, working memory, and language-related processing.  Increase and it's involced in attention, working memory, and language-related processing. Not conclusive but I'd expect that to boost these important skills.  The other refers to the insula and increases there and that effecting emotional processing. Again increase to me seems to be more likely to mean improve than harm. I'd post the quote snippet from the article but I'm on my phone and keeping the part I copied before to quote and getting the other quote is tricky. I will hit """"Post"""" and then edit to add that quote in a second.  And in any case if there is a good reason to assume this effect is negative can someone explain. Despite the tone implying this to be negative the article never explains why it would be negative. """"Alter"""" just means change the brain being altered is not inherently negative.  EDIT: The other quote from the article:  >VBM showed peak increases in 17 regions, including the middle frontal gyrus, the superior frontal gyrus, which is involved in attention, planning, and decision-making, and the insula.  >The insula has a key role in integrating sensory, motor, and autonomic feedback from the body. It‚Äôs involved in emotional processing, self-awareness, and understanding social context.  If everything is an increase that's not a guarantee that it's good but to me it seems likely to be good. Intuitively more brain volume should mean more function.

fitness,1m748p3,n4pxyys,2025-07-23T14:38:21,"Gentlemen,   The time has come to discuss your barbell rows.  Also known as your shrug/upright row/clean combo.    Now, to get out in front of this perceived objection.  I am aware that barbell rows are a movement that can be benefitted by a little extra momentum.  I also understand that dead rows are a thing.  But this isn't either one of those.  I am not going to argue about some good old-fashioned cheaty rows and completely get and endorse having good form for the bulk of the set and then getting a little loose to squeeze out an extra rep or two.  But that is not what I am seeing.  You know what the difference is between cheat rows and whatever it is you are doing?  Technique and range of motion.  Let's ask ourselves how free weights provide resistance.  Gravity.  This is why weights are heavy.   To best utilize gravity in our training we want to move the weight in a perpendicular line to the ground.  This is where the bent over part of the row comes in.  But many of you instead choose too much weight to be able to bring your torso to the appropriate forward angle.  You end up barely bent over and you mostly move the weight parallel to the ground.  This is not what we are looking for.  You want to move your elbow through as much range in a line perpendicular to the floor as possible.    Alternatively, there are some who choose to do a row/foam roll combo for their rows.  By this I mean you """"foam roll"""" a 4"""" area of your quads as you drag the bar on your legs while also """"rowing"""" the weight through a very limited ROM.  Your body moves a far greater distance that the weight does and it looks ridiculous.  Our final specimen looks like an inflatable wavy arm guy if he were trying to perform a row.  It becomes a full body excersize and everything is moving, except the bar.  It is part clean, part upright row, part shrug.  It is three separate exercises with none of the benefits because the bar only moves about 3"""".  I get it.  Everyone wants to move heavy weight.  And if you would have some humility and work with weights you could actually handle in due time you would be moving heavy weight. Like actually moving it through a useful ROM.  Build your strength, not your egos.",1,False

It's tough to give prescriptive advice without knowing specifics about you, but you can create a plan starting with where you are and increasing the amount slowly.

Barbell linear progression routines are a great workout, and if you don't have any specific goals, doing those 4 compound lifts at that level of intensity will keep you in good shape on it's own as long as you keep pushing yourself to increase (or at least challenge) your TM. You'll eventually hit a point where you can't maintain linear progression and at that point you'll want to switch to a different routine for optimal results, but you don't *have* to be optimal if you don't want to.

Think big rocks:  -Be in a reasonable caloric deficit.  Use a tracker like MyFitnessPal or MacroFactor and track what you eat, HONESTLY.  You don't have to do it the rest of your life, but give it, say, a month or two, to understand where your calories come from, and where you can remove them.  This goes for whether you have PCOS or not. It just might take longer.  To get into that reasonable deficit, you might find obvious/easy things.  For example, if you drink a few cans of coke every day, that's 300-350 calories. Switch to 0 calorie soda, or cut it out altogether if you can. Look for the little things you can change to start with, and try, say, one a week.  Try the soda thing, for example, then try changing or eliminating something else the next week.  -You don't need supplements. At all. Most are bullshit and the ones that DO work are not really important.  -You do not need to run or jog, for example. Especially if you're that heavy, it just ruins your joints.  Go for long walks. Be CONSISTENT. Rain or shine, put your headphones in and go. Take your time, enjoy the fresh air.  This will also benefit your back and hips and over time can help improve your posture too. If you want to do more intense cardio later on, go for it, but the """"right"""" amount of cardio is """"some, that you do consistently, without it sucking.""""  -ANY training is better than nothing, so if you just want to go onto the gym and mess around for a bit, go for it.

They will give you what they think is the safest advice for your long term health.  They do not care if you make progress so their advice is biased towards a specific goal.  If a person chooses to maximize performance at a slight risk to longevity that is okay as well.  There are well established guidelines for how to bulk and cut in a way that is healthy.  Advice needs to be considered in context.  >And if you really wanna talk about your favorite """"professional"""" bodybuilders here, let's remember all of those who have tested positive for PEDs. But that's probably a healthy strategy too, right?  Now you are being purposefully obtuse.  Or perhaps this is your honest take?  First, PED are detrimental to health.  Without question.  To the greater point, are you choosing to exclude natural bodybuilders for a reason other than it suits your argument?  You do realize they are tested for PEDs right?  Not to mention, you side stepped my point.   Bulking and cutting cycles are widely used by people for a reason, they work.  If there were a better way then why would so many choose to still bulk/cut?  There is a reason professional lifters do it.  There is a reason the lifting based scientific community prescribes it.  It works.    You don't have to like what is.  You don't have to ever bulk or cut.  There are plenty of recomp enthusiasts out there.  You have siloed yourself into a worldview.  I understand I am wasting my time",4,False

Hardly any sweets, no sugar water, no alcohol.      The problem is I eat too much, my portions are quite big. I tried to reduce them, but had no luck - overeating is probably my only stress relief at the moment.

I suggest working on other forms of stress relief to address your overeating. Things that worked for me include:  * Locking in my sleep duration and regularity. (Duration has really helped with food cravings, regularity has helped a lot  with blood sugar control, worth about 20mg/dl fasting glucose). * Getting a lot of exercise has made my body steer towards notionally dense foods.  * Choosing exercises I enjoy over exercises the internet says are """"optimal"""" has helped me get a lot of exercise in.

I currently find the best balance of calories, nutrition, and satiety with a medium sized protein heavy breakfast, a large lunch loaded with complex carbs and fat (3-4 hours before my workout), a small snack of simple carbs 30min pre-workout, and a small dinner post-workout.

There is sometimes a foot pedal to move them forward so you can get in and out of the machine easily.   Force curve is worth looking into yourself if you're interested in what makes some machines better than others, it's just both not super important and hard to summerize in a short reply.  All of that said, you should consider trying to use barbells on your own. You don't need to lift the heaviest thing you can (nor should you) to get meaningful strength and size results. If you select a weight you can do for 7-8 reps and then only do sets of 5 you will experience gains in a very safe manner. Growth is about proximity to failure, and if you don't think you can get another rep, just rack the bar. As you get more experienced you'll get a lot better at assessing if you have the gas for another rep or 2.",2,False

You will likely develop knee and back issues by your 30s and 40s still, because you won't have strengthened the soft tissue surrounding these joints.   Stretching is useless unless you develop strength through that increased range of motion. Stretching will also not help with tight muscles, because muscles are tight for a reason.   Often times muscle tension comes from weaknesses that other muscles are compensating for, to the point where it gets overworked, tight, and eventually strained. Stretching can temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but the weakness still exists.   Resistance training doesn't even take all that much time or effort.

But you MUST do some kind of resistance training to build muscle if you want to live a good QUALITY life.  Having good muscle mass means a far FAR lower risk of nagging aches and pains from a variety of daily activities, from carrying groceries to walking up steps.  It also gives much better odds of recovering FROM injuries, whether it's falling when you slip on ice, or even from major surgeries or cancer treatments.  Society as a whole does have an obesity problem, but I think I agree with Mark Bell more and more these days that it has almost EQUALLY a problem with society being UNDERMUSCLED.

I want to maintain my muscle and gain/maintain my strength but I'd also like to finish the weight loss phase as fast as possible.  These are opposing goals.  To best preserve muscle and strength, you would want a very conservative deficit.  To lose weight as fast as possible, you need a large deficit.  So pick which one is more important.  Most people opt for the faster cut assuming that what they lose will come back quickly on their next bulk.  Losing .5-1% BW should preserve most of your lean mass.    >\- How long should I cut for? I was thinking of getting down to 180lbs and then starting a bulk again. Would this be a good idea or should I cut down even more so I can gain weight for longer?  This comes down to how lean you would be.  Getting very lean is counterproductive in my mind unless that is your goal.   The leaner you get, the harder to preserve muscle mass and strength. Also if I recall you will tend to put on more fat than muscle at the start of the bulk.

I used to be extremely lean and muscular, but then went off the deep end a while back because of a bad breakup, mental health issues, a cross-country move, the list could go on. I lost 20-ish pounds over several months through eating in an unhealthily low-calorie diet with very little protein while lifting. Starting in April, I started training for a 10k and decided to eat more (1400-1700 calories a day) and make sure I got sufficient protein while still lifting.  After hitting a PR in my 10k, I'm now training for a half marathon (running 4 days a week) while keeping up with lifting six times a week, and I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels. I feel absolutely skinny fat, and even though I have some visible muscle and my abs pop depending on the day, I hate the amount of fat I have all over my body. I've been at this same weight before with less fat and more muscle, and I just don't know if the answer is to eat at maintenance, cut, or bulk to achieve my aesthetic goals and my fitness goals at the same time. I also just don't know about cutting even more, as it messes with my mind and I'm not sure if I'll be happy with my body cutting 5-10 more pounds.

Mainly bodyweight exercises (I am insanely weak) and lifting with a 6kg and 8kg kettlebell.

I've logged food pretty religiously, and any time I ate something that might have put me over my daily limit I was certainly never going over my maintenance amount, just not as in as deep a deficit.  I know it does boil down to a basic in/out, so if I'm not losing weight I'm not in enough of a deficit or I'm eating more than I think (which I don't think is the case), it's just hard to figure out what the amount should be.

Seeing as I do squats and calf raises in the same day currently, I feel it would be silly to bring two pairs of shoes to the gym for just one exercise.

fitness,1m2xc91,n3we67j,2025-07-18T22:36:11,"its a spectrum.    a 100lb female powerlifter whos max is 150 can train bench at high intensity maybe 2-3x per week with a shit ton of volume.    a 190lb male powerlifter whos max is 350 can train bench hard maybe once per week. the absolute weight is probably an independent recovery tax. if they press 3x per week they are most certainly using submaximal days or variations such as larsen/spoto/dumbbell to fill in volume.     i would surmise that the stronger lifter‚Äôs joints take a greater beating from greater absolute load. using variation will make it so that they take a beating from slightly different angles instead of speedrunning overuse from loading the same positions with every single rep of pressing. ie if i had to be punched 100 times i‚Äôm not taking every single punch on the same spot of my body i‚Äôm asking for a few here a few there etc.      its probably a bit less of a concern for bodybuilding where your rep ranges will usually be 5+, but equally your proximity to failure is always high by default whereas powerlifters use more submax.      i feel like youd know if you cant do the exact same movement twice a week like if i were jordan peters or dorian yates im not hack squatting twice a week, i‚Äôd probably alternate with leg press etc.. id vary for mostly the same reasons as you though",1,False
fitness,1m2xc91,n46ebat,2025-07-20T15:14:07,"You shouldn't need any specific warmup unless something is causing discomfort. You could try moving your arms around in gentle circles if you want something. And do the same with your shoulders, move them in gentle circles.  If you can't do unassisted negatives yet, dead hangs can be a good way to build strength! Just hang on the bar as long as you can. I've also heard good things about scapular pullups. That might help strengthen your upper back, which might be the limiting factor if your back is feeling tired when you do pullups!  And if you have access to machines, you could try lat pulldowns, or (non-elastic) assisted pullups if there is an assisted pullup machine near you.  The only reason I recommend trying ways other than with elastics is because elastics provide more support at the bottom of the movement than at the top, so they might be getting in the way of building strength throughout the whole range of motion. If you're not progressing, this might be why. But if you feel like they're helping, you would know best!  Also, make sure you watch a few videos for good form on youtube if you haven't already :) and maybe post a clip of your pullups on r/formcheck !",1,False

So maybe the first day you do 7x10 and a week or two later you're doing 20, 20, 20, 10, and then when you start to do sets of 25+ you might say, these are getting too easy, so I'm going to switch to kneeling ab rollouts and see how many sets it takes me to do 50 of those. When those get easy, maybe you're ready to move on to the standing kind. Or if we're talking about a weighted exercise, you'd add weight.   You can also check out """"density training"""" which is a similar idea but where you track how many reps you can do in a set time, such as 10 minutes, resting as needed while the timer is still going.   Lots of ways to get strong. Just pick a system and stick with it for a while.",1,False

fitness,1m22ltz,n4e0fdb,2025-07-21T18:46:06,"You have to work on both in parallel. (I'm a USAW-L2 coach.) If your question is just about the order of lifting in a workout, it's competition lifts first, strength lifts after.  For the competition lifts, work on technique, but don't be afraid to lift as heavy as your abilities allow. If you're missing (failing) lifts at a certain weight, take some weight off so you can practice making the lift. But if the bar is moving well, there's no need to keep it super light.   *At the same time*, make sure your workouts include strength work also. Don't stop squatting. *Do* add pulls and lift-offs that prioritize weightlifting positions. So, for example, do """"clean deadlifts"""" where you keep the same body positioning as a clean. It will be very different from a conventional deadlift since you're staying over the bar at the start, scooping your knees under a little, etc.   As you get better at the competition lifts, you'll get more of a strength stimulus from your work with the competition lifts. Weightlifters typically train 1-2 competition lifts followed by 1-2 strength lifts (mostly squats and pulls) in the same workout.   Here's the general order:  \* Warmup/activation lifts, if you're using them  \* Technique primers - ie drills that will help you to do the next exercise better. These can be their own exercise, or they can just be things that you do with the empty bar as you're starting in on your competition lifts for the day.  \* Competition lifts. If you're training snatch and clean & jerk the same day, snatches would usually go first.  \* Squats and/or pulls  \* Isolation exercises, conditioning work, and/or extra bonus strength work (pull-ups, dips, etc) would go last if your workout has these.   Presses (like a standing strict press) can go pretty much anywhere - do them before the competition lifts if you want to think of them as a warmup or primer, or stick them at the end with isolations if they're just in there for extra strength work.",1,False

fitness,1m22ltz,n3yb3f2,2025-07-19T06:21:18,Honestly I think the best initial goal for any recreational lifter is bodybuilding (hypertrophy). Here is why:   - noticeable results and motivating ‚Äòpumps‚Äô.  - a high variety of exercises available all pretty much equally effective.  - learning of correct single joint movement patterns and mind muscle connections that can later help a lot if you choose a strength based sport.  - still increase your strength anyway.    I used to think ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be a bodybuilder I want to squat 500 and be huge because I do‚Äù. And so I trained on powerlifting programs right from the start. I didn‚Äôt see much visual progress and the weight stopped increasing after a while and it was just horrible.   After switching to bodybuilding I can now use any exercise I want in that day and am not restricted by a movement. For example for some reason dumbbell bench press feels much better than barbell. So I don‚Äôt do barbell and see massive improvements in size and strength like never before.

fitness,1m22ltz,n3tcu0c,2025-07-18T13:40:16,"So first of all, there isn't anything *wrong* with these programs. In the sense that, I don't want you to think that if you're doing them then you're wasting your time in the gym. Furthermore, if you're relatively new, your effort and consistency and diet will far outweigh the specific program you are on, especially if you are following a not-shit program.  I am also not saying that compound lifts, or barbell lifts, or useless and should not be included in a program.  However, I do think that these older, minimalistic programs, are not what I would prescribe to someone who is primarily interested in bodybuilding. This is because of a few things  I think that the mindset that they engender pushes you away from the mindset you should have if you are interested in lifting for your physique. This is hard to describe until you've really experienced it, but these linear progression programs kind of put it into your brain that the goal of lifting is to put 2.5-5lbs on the bar when you go into the gym ever session on your main barbell lifts. That is not your goal.  What these programs have in common is a hard emphasis on *progression,* and specifically, an emphasis on progression on squat, bench, and deadlift. They will help you accumulate a lot of strength early on. This isn't a bad goal, but this just isn't the goal of bodybuilding. The goal of bodybuilding is to accumulate quality reps over many exercises that grow all of your muscles. Often, I think that these LP programs push people's strengths too fast, and they hit hard plateaus and need to do a lot of troubleshooting. And then once they plateau, and start troubleshooting, what is their goal? The goal of the troubleshooting just becomes to put more weight on the bar.  The entire mindset just shifts you away from bodybuilding. It is possible to build a lot of strength without building a lot of muscle.   By placing so much focus on SBD, these programs often neglect programming/focus on isolation lifts. They often don't even have clear isolation work, but instead just have you pick from some list of accessory lifts. This is again, just completely contrary to the goal of bodybuilding. In bodybuilding, your isolation lifts are just as important, and often more important, than your compound lifts, and deserve just as much focus in programming. Instead, they sometimes just have you choose """"1-2 accessory lifts.""""  They are all also very, very low volume. For a complete beginner this isn't an issue, but for bodybuilding you need more volume than they prescribe.  These are kind of my biggest issues. Let me use Greyskull's LP as an example, in the way that OP wrote their program. Let's even assume for a moment that OP is not alternating lateral raises, curls, and lat pulldowns, and is doing all three every single workout.  So you're on average, doing 4.5 sets of bench press and 4.5 sets of OHP a week, along with lateral raises. There is no triceps isolation work at all, and especially no triceps isolation work for the long head, which is not going to be heavily used in pressing movements. This is overall low chest volume, but on a complete beginner program, it's fine. But I wouldn't have someone who is serious about bodybuilding do only 4.5 sets of bench press a week for chest development for more than a few months.  You're doing 4.5 sets of squats a week and 4.5 sets of deadlifts a week. That is all the volume you are doing for your lower body. That is super, super low volume, even for a minimalist program, and I would say is an actively poor part of this program.  And it's just fundamentally missing things that I think everyone should do. You are doing no biceps isolations in this program. No horizontal pulling. No calf work. No direct ab work.    >Most of what I read though recommends building some general strength before trying to do a more physique-oriented program.  I see this idea being thrown around a lot, but why? Why do you need your strength, in 3-4 very specific, very technical movements, to be at a certain point before you are """"allowed"""" to take your biceps training, your ab training, your triceps training, your side delt training, your rear delt training, your lat training, etc, seriously?   So often, beginners start in the gym with the goal of building a better physique, which is essentially what bodybuilding is to 99% of people, and instead get pushed onto these programs that have you just load weight onto the bar, and your entire mindset just becomes """"how do I PR these lifts.""""

And I also do agree that routine hopping out of FOMO is going to hold the majority of lifters back as well, especially if that routine hopping is going to ultimately decrease their ability to focus on what matters (lifting with good form, at high intensities)  >The volume on these LP programs is definitely low, but the explanation I've heard for that is that while you still have """"newbie gains"""" to make, you don't need very high volume to stimulate muscle growth (not sure if that's true).  This is true, which is why I'm generally not too critical about the low volume. But some of the volume is *so low* that I think it is worth bringing up as a notable negative for these minimalist programs.  >Also, very specific isolation movements to build particular muscles for one's physique are probably not super relevant when you have a low amount of muscle to begin with.  I actually strongly disagree with this. Why is building your biceps, the largest part of your triceps (the long head), your abs, your rear delts, and your entire upper back less relevant just because you don't have a lot of muscle in your chest, front delt, and legs, which are going to be the main movers of the bench press, the squat, and the deadlift?  Put another way, if your goal is to eventually have a complete, well rounded physique, you need to learn to train those muscles eventually, and I don't know why it makes sense to wait and neglect them until you arbitrarily have an acceptable SBD total. That's fundamentally not a bodybuilding mindset, I would consider it a powerlifting mindset, which is again not our goal here.  >I'd be happy to hear if you have any recommendation for other routines to transition into though.

As your training age you should not be adjusting your program to focus on specific body parts.   I would say that this is not a very good program to be honest with you. It does not surprise me that your leg work is stalling.  Some feedback for your program, based just on the info you gave me...  1. This is a small point, but you should include overhead triceps work into your program. It will bias the long head of your triceps which is an important muscle for aesthetics  2. More importantly, your leg work is bad. There is a lot to talk about, but the biggest issues are all fundamentally rooted that you are doing only one leg day a week, and that leg day is really half assed and doesn't have anything in it. Some specifics-- **a)** You just do not have enough volume for your quads. **b)** You do not do any heavy hip hinge like a RDL or a conventional Deadlift. A back extension is not going to substitute a hip hinge **c)** You do have enough volume for your hamstrings. **d)** You do not have enough volume for your glutes.  Basically your leg day just doesn't have anything in it.  I strongly recommend doing two Lower Body days in a week. I don't think it makes sense to do this weird body part split where your Thursday/Friday is a bunch of random stuff.  If you want to do 5 days lifting, you can do 3 upper and 2 lower body days.

fitness,1m17ol1,n3g9c2z,2025-07-16T14:21:50,"Gentlemen, we need to talk about the dumbbell press. Both incline and flat.  If all you are going to do is partial range of motion may I introduce you to a different piece of equipment, it's calmed the floor.  The exercise you are doing is called a floor press, just without the floor.  If you are not going to bring your elbows past the midline (coronal plane) of your body, then the floor is the way to go.  More stability, less risk for you free falling your weights, and most importantly, you don't waste a bench.  Most of you would not even touch the floor since you cut your reps so short.  What, after all, is the purpose of a dumbbell press versus a bench press? It is less stable, it is more difficult to set up, of course some may prefer to have their hands not locked in to a bar path, but the real advantage is to get a deeper stretch at the bottom.  Granted with heavier dumbbells, it can be harder to do due to their size, but still possible.  As with all lifts, stop skipping the hard part, that's the part that is good for you.  Another thing, if you cannot carry your dumbbells from the rack to your bench (preferably floor) then they are too heavy for you.  Please stop rolling them with your foot, or making two trips with one dumbbell each time.  If you are strong enough to actually press them, you should be strong enough to carry them.  But maybe that it the problem.  Furthermore, control your weights.  At the end of your set pull the weights in, sit up, stand up, place your weights on the floor.  And don't give me the excuse of how heavy they are.   If you are strong enough to press them, it should not be an issue.",13,False

The program that I mentioned has you doing close to 20 sets per week and most of them are far from failure. The bench seems to benefit a lot from submaximal work.

This has gone well, I have been growing and getting stronger, but now I'm running into a problem.

The volume is overall extremely high,  but there are also body parts that are not getting enough attention.     My overall advice  1. Slightly reduce volume across the board.

Then if I do a daily 350 cal deficit in week 5, I can cut all the fat I‚Äôve gained during that 4 week period and keep most of the muscle. Rinse, repeat for 6-12 months.  If you're happy with your physique then that's great. More power to you, and maintaining a physique is much easier than getting it. Many, many people are happy with and look great at an """"early intermediate"""" physique.   However, don't gaslight yourself or trick yourself into thinking that trying to manipulate your calories such that you gain almost no fat is going to get you anywhere over the next 6-12 months.  Regardless of whether it can theoretically work, I think that this is way too complicated and not the way you should be thinking about your lifting. I would go as far as to say that this is fundamentally the wrong mindset you should be having as an """"early intermediate"""" lifter who is focused on hypertrophy. You do not need to be focused on this minutia. You do not need to worry about your body fat percent. You do not and cannot predict how your muscle growth and fat gain is going to work over the long term. You just can't.  Listen to me-- building muscle is extremely hard. A lot of things need to go right for it to be an efficient process. You will make a ton of mistakes, and have to figure out a lot of things about your body and what works best for you. You will be shooting yourself in both feet if you are constantly taking yourself out of a calorie surplus, and for what? To maintain a 13% body fat? Who cares??  This obsession with leanness will get you nowhere. You cannot be this attached to it. Here's the reality-- to make progress you need to spend a significant portion of the year at a calorie surplus. And likely, high teens body fat. That is just the reality of building muscle. If you have a lot of anxiety around losing your abs, or anything like that, I strongly recommend getting off of fitness social media.  If you like your body right now, just let yourself enjoy it. I do that all the time, where I eat at roughly maintenance and train less hard. But if you want to build muscle, you can't half ass it by doing these mini bulks.",8,False

When you‚Äôre in the 15% range is really when you‚Äôll feel like a new person. You‚Äôll retain muscle just fine and probably gain muscle during the process with where you‚Äôre at in your journey.   You‚Äôve been running? Is it a controlled and set amount of time or distance? I‚Äôd replace this with something more controlled, it‚Äôs a tool in the toolbox.  You‚Äôre probably not training hard enough. Just start taking every set to technical failure, not some set number of reps.

Log your workouts and beat your logbook each week. It‚Äôs very important to understand that your goal here is to flex the muscle harder and create more tension, not necessarily ‚Äújust‚Äù move the weight. Reps are something quantifiable and serve as a proxy to this idea. Some people this takes a decade or more to understand.   Your workout split probably needs help too. Each muscle group probably needs somewhere between 5-20 working sets (volume) per week. You should shoot for 8-12 for most muscle groups. How you arrange that volume is your workout split. PPL is a good start.   Exercise selection. Barbells aren‚Äôt necessary at all. All you need is something you can progress on for many many weeks. I don‚Äôt use barbells for any lifts really anymore, and I‚Äôm a bodybuilder. In fact, with progression like I outlined, it‚Äôs better to do without a barbell. Make sure you understand how to do each exercise to get exactly the muscles that are intended for that lift. Everyone struggles with shoulders/lateral raises, almost all back movements, and even a lot of arm movements with this concept.   Control your other variables. You say you try to get in 1g protein per lb body weight. But if you just ate the same thing everyday, then you‚Äôd know exactly how many grams of protein you get per day because it‚Äôs the same thing. Sleep, recovery, hydration, stress, meal timing (only in that it‚Äôs a variable removed from your training progression).   Voila, you‚Äôre now a bodybuilder who lives like a monk.

I've done sports almost all my life, except the past year due to a lot of injuries and medical conditions. 3. Basically barely touched alcohol, except the past year. Since I started working out and eating healthy again, I completely cut off alcohol again. 4. Starting weight: 87.9kg. My weight after 4 weeks: 85.6kg. Target: 75kg.  My diet is pretty simple: 1. Every morning: 250gr Greek Yoghurt (0-2% fat), with 70gr frozen fruits, 30gr of unsalted mixed nuts and a little bit of cinnamon. 2. For lunch I mostly eat the same as my breakfast (I love Greek Yoghurt) or I take 2 whole wheat crackers with 2 boiled eggs. 3. For dinner, it's daily variety, but I tend to keep it around 750kcal max.  Drinks: Coffee (2-3 cups a day) and water. I drink at least 2 to 2.5L water.  Workout: When I started again, my aim was to go 3 times a week for 1 hour. Both cardio and strength. But since I'm so motivated and completely fell in love with the gym again, I'd like to go 5 days a week. Before my injuries I was an addict, keeping stats of everything and aimed to improve even a single kg per training. Now i take it a bit slower and I """"just want to get fit"""".

And I always end with 15 minutes incline treadmill (max incline, that's 15% on our treadmills @ 6km/h)  Why this thread? I know weight loss and fitness is a marathon.

Similarly, your overall back volume is also really low. On your pull day you're doing 4 total sets of pulls, and on your upper day you're doing 4 total sets of pulls. It makes no sense at all to do 8 pulls a week for your back and 10 sets of biceps curls. Your back needs more volume than your biceps.  3. For your legs, I don't see the point of doing 8-12 reps of a squat and 8-12 reps of a deadlift. These are extremely tiring, full body exercises, and I don't really think you're going to get that much out of super high rep sets for these.

fitness,1lxtxrm,n2qg4q8,2025-07-12T14:39:18,"This week at the gym I saw something that bewildered me: a small woman, maybe about 110 pounds body weight, wearing loose long pants and a loose T-shirt (probably not very jacked, but hard to tell under all that clothing) went to the squat rack next to mine and set the barbell on the safeties at the level of her armpits. At first I didn't really see what she was doing ('cause I was minding my own business and doing my sets). She put on some weight, went to the bar, put on more weight, went to the bar, put on a little more weight...  Finally, I saw that she got under the bar in what would be a pretty normal starting position for unracking a squat, stood up, lifting the bar \*maybe\* 2 inches off the safeties, lowered to the starting position and sat down to rest. Then added 5 # more and repeated. By the time I left that area of the gym, she was probably using right around three times her body weight.

The hips shooting back is also a sign of your body trying to recruit your glutes and hamstrings to move the weight, which is a sign that your quads are weak by comparison.    These are my two best guesses.  Your hips come back, your back angle changes, the bar may travel forward (can't tell but likely) past the center of your foot, which diminishes your leverages.

I'm also usually too sweaty and out of breath for the college kids at my gym to want to talk to me anyway. : )      My resistance workout is a little complicated to write out, because I split it into three 10-minute supersets in order to get to failure on most of my individual exercises, keep my heart rate up, and still maximize rest time for each muscle group.         But in total, it basically consists of:  50-60 strict pull-ups (mixed-grip, 1/3 weighted)   25-30 unsupported handstand push-ups   75-100 mixed pushups   300 bicycle crunches   30-50 weighted decline crunches   30-50 hanging leg raises  (On leg days, I'll reduce this workout and do a 5-set pyramid on the 45-degree hip sled as heavy as I can go without injuring my knees.  On those days, I'll also occasionally do some bench presses and dumbbell curls if the Smith machine and benches are free.)  After resistance training, I run on the treadmill for 20 minutes.        My total workout takes an hour, burns about 500-700 calories, and I go 3 or 4 days a week.  I've also been running outside a bit lately too, even though it's hot and I kind of hate it.   Despite trying to eat at maintenance, I've gained about 5 lbs of muscle in the last 5-6 months.  I've gotten MUCH stronger and more fit in that time though.

Start building some muscle now, so you don't wake up chubby one day like I did, and have to go through the whole weight-loss part of getting into shape.  It *sucks*.

That's 120 squats.    Strength Development has you doing 8 sets of 8 reps with a 40s lifting / 20s pause. That's 64 squats.

Outside of a max effort set, I don't feel my lower back much at all.  While I do not think you need to worry about feeling a muscle, feeling a deadlift primarily in your lower ack tends to indicate you are lifting with your back and not by pushing your hips through.  Feedback from gym goers can be good, but I would not trust 99% of the people at my gyms to critique my form.  Post a form check.  Also, work on your cues and try and focus on driving the hips through and your feet through the floor.  Many people just think lift the weight, and we are trained to lift with our backs.  RDLs, when done correctly, are a great way to learn how to hinge and drive with your hips.  Final thought, it could be your bracing needs work.  If you have a soft brace, you need to pull the slack out of your back to get force to the bar. This can lead to rounding and additional stress on the lower back.  It does not take excessive rounding for this to be the case.  Bonus thought, strength imbalance between your back and glutes/hamstrings?  Again, I would post a form check.",2,False

I compete, and have been deadlifting for quite a while now, and I still rarely feel them in my glutes either (but if it's a PR, you better believe I feel it in my ass 2 days later).  You can't deadlift without using your back, and obsessing over feeling it in one muscle or not feeling it in another leads to madness.  Having said that, like I said, form is a skill to pursue, so keep at it.  In terms of """"waking up the glutes"""" to help make your deadlifts more efficient, RDLs like mentioned below is a great way to focus the """"feeling"""" on glutes and hammies.

My advice would be to slightly reduce.  Your upper body training is solid I think. I like your exercise selection and your volume distribution.  Your leg training is obviously not ideal.

If you count fractional set volume, you're at 25 sets/week (16 of which are direct) which is beyond what most physique competitors program. All pull work hits your biceps to some extent so programming multiple curls for 4x is a weird choice. None of your curls use lengthened bias either, so implementing cable or preacher curls would be beneficial.  Back width is mostly from vertical pulls, and you have no notes on grip width or orientation on those movements, but those should be varied to some degree, biasing towards narrower grips for maximal lat stretch. Volume seems low at 12 sets, so I would probably bump them all to 4 sets. If you have a chest supported row I would use that in place of one of the cable row sets, or do a BB/T-bar row if your legs tolerate it just for some free bracing work for core.  You may also be able to get higher quality sets in by rearranging your push days so they are more evenly distributed by muscle use. Push 1 has 3 back-to-back front delt movements which might be great to feel a pump, but that doesn't actually mean you're growing more muscle.

fitness,1lvdyaa,n25m8iu,2025-07-09T11:21:18,"[Here is my previous rant about the invasive species of old people at my gym for context](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/19ednyo/rant_wednesday/kjcurtd/). TL:DR There are packs of old people that walk in giant circles at my gym including through crowded weight lifting areas.  Things calmed down a bit after my rant. There was a unwritten armistice or ceasefire with most of the packs. I thought I could return to normal gym life. Unfortunetly there are 3 old dudes that walk shoulder to shoulder 3 people wide and refuse to move out of people's way. They shamble around the gym like zombies for hours at a time.  I have a very simple rules for right of ways at the gym. 1. I move out of the way if someone is doing an exercise. 2. I move out of the way if someone is carrying weight or carrying more weight than me. I think these are simple rules for maneuvering around the gym.  The pack of 3 old dudes or 3 spotted lantern flies spit in the face of these rules. Here's the bullshit they have done in the past few months:  1. I'm doing front lateral raises. The area I am doing them is narrow so no one can really walk in front of me. Unless you are fucking Lionfish of the gym. The 3 old dudes walk in front of me forcing me to stop mid-set. One of them has the fucking gall to point to where I should be lifting.    2. I'm laying doing a set on the hip thrust machine. Behind me is a narrow part of the gym. One of the kudzu vine fuckers is shambling behind me and elbows me in the head. I shout """"What the fuck?!?!"""" a woman nearby laughs and the 3 old dudes just keep walking. 3. I'm returning a 70 lb dumbbell. I'm walking to return it and I have to move past the 3 asian carp assholes. I think """"they will move out of my way, I'm carrying a large dumbbell."""" Nope, one of them runs directly into me. Another one turns and says something to me. I have my headphones in so idk what they said. A random dude walks up to me and asks if I'm okay and talks about how he hates the old people too. 4. I want to use the decline bench. There is no barbell on the decline bench. I grab a barbell from a flat bench and start walking towards the decline bench. The 3 Emerald Ash Borers are walking in my way. I try to move past them but am forced to stop so I don't run into them. I say loudly """"are you actually fucking kidding me?"""" One of them says something and snarls; again I have my headphones in.  5. Same day and not 5 minutes past the last point. I am getting up from the decline bench where I had my legs locked in. One of the feral boars runs into me and tells me to watch what I am doing. They just keep shambling. I'm done at this point so I loudly tell them to go fuck themselves. One of them turns around and says something to me. I point to the treadmills and ellipticals and say they can just use those. He snarls and goes back to his pack. Another random dude walks up to me and asks if I am okay and then goes into a 3 minute rant about how much he hates these people.  I'm not a confrontational person. The biggest problem I have ever had with someone at the gym is """"hey, I was using that."""" I have complained to the front desk at the gym 4 times now. I have complained to management at any organization 4 times in my entire life. I'm so fucking tired of these invasive species ass gym zombies.

I now weigh 162.9 pounds (naked) and based on how I look in the mirror I believe I've lost at least 1.5 inches (max 2 inches) of circumference if measured just below my bellow button. So it's possible I've gained a total of 4-5 pounds of muscle, correct?  I've gained a noticeable amount of muscle in my chest, my pecks now hide all my ribs except for what's visible under my armpit close to my abdomen.  I used to be able to see both bones in my forearms clearly, now they are hidden by muscle.  I never had much in the way of triceps before, now my triceps are noticeably built.  My biceps have also progressed, by checking with my fingers they've grown almost 1.5 inches in circumference. Although they still appear fairly small, albeit I was starting from almost nothing.  My shoulders have progressed in strength (can tell from my work) but not very much in visible muscle volume.  My abs are not visible yet, but my stomach is noticeably flatter and my abs feel much less squishy even when not flexing them.  I haven't been doing any exercises that target the back, however despite that I have noticeable improvements in my back muscles and my back ribs are no longer visible.

It sounds like you've never really had an extended period of your life where you took training really seriously, and I am guessing that your overall muscular development is relatively low. I'm guessing for example that you can't clear a 200 lb bench press, or a 250lb squat, or a 335 lb deadlift.   These numbers aren't the end-all-be-all, and you shouldn't make your entire program goals around hitting arbitrary strength standards, but I just bring them up as examples. If you cannot easily clear these numbers, you just don't have a ton of muscle on your body, and you're a beginner in terms of physique.  As someone with a beginner's physique, if you want a physique of an intermediate lifter, you need to build muscle. Which means you need to gain weight.  I assume this is true? If so, the reality is that you've been making really slow progress. So my advice is to figure out why you have been making really slow progress, because most men should be able to hit the numbers I outlined above easily within 2 years of lifting.   > I'm looking to ideally lose some abdominal fat (the primary region where I accrue fat), some double chin fat, and get a bit more toned with hopefully bigger arms.  I would not worry about this if I were you. The reason is because you have a version of your head of what you want your body to look like when you cut down. I'm telling you that you will not look like that. You will not be impressed by the result of a cut at this stage.   More to the point here-- you need to lock in your training consistency, effort, and technique before you start to worry about this. My recommendation is to spend a few months locking in your training, and then spending ~5-6 months at a surplus to build muscle. I don't even need to see your physique to give you this advice.

What I found was you want to enter """"sedentary"""" and don't account for your cardio/workouts when calculating TDEE. With those stats in the first calculator I found, my TDEE was calculated to be 2,207.   Now if you want to lose weight, aim for a deficit, somewhere between 250-500 calories a day, or 1,750-3,500 calories a week. You'll have to play around with it a bit and see what works, lower or raise your calories if you are failing to lose weight or losing too much weight over the course of a week or two. If my goal is to lose weight and maintain muscle, I would aim for 0.7g-1.2g of protein per pound of lean body mass (not total body weight), and divide up carbs and fat at a ratio that works for you. Keep your fat above 40g at least (I aim for 60 personally or .3g/lb).   So with that breakdown, I would aim for 1,750 calories a day,175g of protein, 131g carbs, and 58g fat (40%/30%/30%). If I'm feeling like I don't have enough energy I would add more carbs and drop my protein and fat numbers, maybe something like 153g protein, 175g carbs, 48g fat (35%/40%/25%). If that still isn't enough I would just add more calories and tweak it from there.   My current plan is to try to stick around 1,800 calories, get 10k steps a day, and do intermittent fasting (IF) for 16:8 eating between noon to 6pm. Don't beat yourself up if you have a bad week, an event where you blow your calories, or can't hit a goal.

fitness,1ltnlut,n1rz8on,2025-07-07T08:51:22,"Subject: 17 Days Away, Now Down with COVID ‚Äì Scared I‚Äôm Eating Too Much and Losing Everything  Hey all, I‚Äôm really hoping someone here can talk some sense into me, or at least let me know I‚Äôm not alone. I‚Äôve been struggling badly the last few days, and I need to get this out.  I‚Äôm 17, about 179cm, and sit at around 56kg with very low body fat‚Äîlast measured at 5.4%. I‚Äôve always had a really lean, defined look, with abs and visible muscle tone. I care a lot about maintaining that. Maybe too much. I‚Äôll admit it sounds obsessive, but I think I‚Äôve developed some level of body dysmorphia‚ÄîI constantly second-guess myself, my food, my physique, even if nothing‚Äôs changed.  At home, I have a really locked-in routine: 	‚Ä¢	I climb (bouldering) 5x a week‚ÄîMonday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. 	‚Ä¢	I do strength-focused gym workouts twice a week‚ÄîMonday and Thursday mornings. 	‚Ä¢	I do two planks a day‚Äîan 8-minute one in the morning, a 5-minute one at night‚Äîand light push-ups/pull-ups through the day. 	‚Ä¢	I walk plenty just from school and daily life, and I rarely ever take more than a single full rest day.  My diet is super structured and consistent: 	‚Ä¢	Breakfast: BC Raspberry Truffle protein bar (108 kcal, 11g protein), 125g berries, 2 slices of high-tin sourdough multigrain toast with jam. 	‚Ä¢	Lunch: A chicken, lentil, avocado, and vegetable wrap (sometimes homemade, sometimes packed for school). 	‚Ä¢	3pm Snack: A second protein bar (same or similar macro breakdown). 	‚Ä¢	Dinner: Either a home-cooked meal of chicken breast with broccoli, carrots, and a bit of brown rice or lentils ‚Äî or, if I‚Äôm out, I‚Äôll get: 	‚Ä¢	A poke bowl (with chicken or salmon, brown rice base, clean toppings like zucchini, cucumber, seaweed salad, no sauces), or 	‚Ä¢	Worst-case: a clean Zambrero‚Äôs burrito ‚Äî pulled pork or chicken, black rice, guacamole, no cheese, no sour cream, no jalape√±os, and either no sauce or a tiny amount of chipotle. 	‚Ä¢	Pre-bed Snack: 2 more slices of high-tin sourdough toast with jam, another 125g of berries, and a small muesli bar (~113 kcal).  I eat like this every single day, and it‚Äôs helped me maintain my form and feel strong and in control. But now everything‚Äôs flipped.  I just got back from a 17-day overseas performing arts trip through Europe, where I couldn‚Äôt access a gym or climbing wall. I walked a lot but wasn‚Äôt doing my regular training. I brought my protein and muesli bars and stuck to clean food when I could, but I still ate out almost every meal. I was worried but knew I‚Äôd get straight back to routine once I got home.  But right as I got back‚Ä¶ I got COVID.  I‚Äôve had fevers (38¬∞C), fatigue, a sore throat‚Äîeverything. I‚Äôm completely bedridden and have been since Sunday. It‚Äôs now Monday night, and I know for sure I won‚Äôt be able to work out until Thursday or Friday at the absolute earliest, maybe even later.  And here‚Äôs the problem:  I‚Äôm still eating exactly like I do when I‚Äôm training.  Not because I‚Äôm bingeing‚Äîbecause I don‚Äôt do that‚Äîbut because my meals are so structured I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I‚Äôm still having my full breakfast, lunch, protein bar, dinner, and pre-bed snack. Even when I‚Äôm not hungry. Even when I feel bloated. Even when I‚Äôve literally been in bed all day doing under 1000 steps.  And I feel terrible about it.  I feel like I‚Äôm over-eating, like I‚Äôm undoing all my progress. I keep thinking: 	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not moving‚Äîhow can you still eat like this?‚Äù 	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to gain fat.‚Äù 	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYour abs will be gone in days.‚Äù 	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt going to bounce back.‚Äù  I‚Äôve probably had body image struggles for a while, but being so inactive while still eating like I‚Äôm training is sending me over the edge mentally. I feel guilty after every meal even though it‚Äôs clean food. I‚Äôve even started questioning whether to skip snacks or meals, even if I know that‚Äôs not the answer.  The worst part is the fear that this won‚Äôt go back to normal. That even if I get better by Friday and start training again, I‚Äôll be puffy, slower, weaker. That my lean look will be gone. That I won‚Äôt feel like myself.  So yeah‚ÄîI guess I‚Äôm reaching out to ask: 	‚Ä¢	Has anyone been through a period like this‚Äîwhere you‚Äôve had to stop everything, while still eating normally? 	‚Ä¢	Did your body actually change as much as you feared? 	‚Ä¢	Is it really okay to keep eating like this while I recover?  I know some part of me knows the logical answer, but I need to hear it from people who‚Äôve lived it. Because right now I feel like I‚Äôm losing control‚Äîand I know deep down that‚Äôs the hardest part for me.  Thanks so much to anyone who‚Äôs read this far. I appreciate it more than you know.

Sometimes I do feel aches the next day, but it's starting to lessen as I repeat the same workouts (even with higher weights/reps) I guess what I am asking is when I complete my workouts how should I feel?   2.)   Does anyone have tips for increasing strength in your non-dominant arm/for catching your non-dominant arm slacking?--> I've started to notice that my left arm seems to have found ways to cheat out of exercises. I've done my best to catch it but overall any tips. Do I need to do extra workouts with just that arm to help it catch up?

Right now I run around a mile per day (4-5 days per week), with hopes of getting to at least a mile and a half by the end of the month. However, every time I run I seem to only be able to think about how I want to stop running. I've tried music, podcasts, YouTube videos, silence, etc. and haven't found something that makes it enjoyable. If anyone has any tips for this that would be amazing!

Proper programming insures that you rarely if ever attempt a 1rm (unless you compete), and properly titrates your load through progressive overload.  >The second solution, or so I hear, is to deliberately train lifts where the goal is to bend your back (spinal flexion), so in case you accidentally slip or let go of your brace, your back can handle that situation.  I'm pleased you at least discovered this, because one of the worst parts of modern fitness culture is the belief that people are made of glass and minor differences in form will break you in half.  So yes, with proper programming and LOAD MANAGEMENT, you can do things like Jefferson Curls, Atlas Stones, sandbag loading, etc etc with a rounded back, in disadvantaged positions, and make yourself stronger in those positions.

The best ways to prevent injury are to improve your lift form, don't take shortcuts, and to be reasonable with how much you push yourself. I've hurt myself multiple times in the gym, and one of those things were to blame every time. If you need to squat just the barbell for reps for a few weeks to get the movement down and learn your cues, that's totally fine. You aren't competing with anyone at the gym but yourself, and if you rush to a weight you can't handle you'll only be setting yourself back.  If you don't feel like you can lift enough to really work on your form without hurting yourself, putting aside the barbell lifts for awhile to focus on safer alternative exercises might be a good solution.

When you are pushing every set hard, and you are unable to lift the weight anymore because you are close to muscular failure. If you are being limited by cardiovascular fatigue, mental stress, or muscle soreness, you are using too light weights.  To give you some perspective, most of the time I lift weights I am doing between 6 and 12 reps.  >They're currently set at 1kg each and I'm doing five sets of ten overhead presses (I am unclear if this is the correct name of the movement, but I start with my hands at my sides, do a bicep curl, then push them above my head, then lower them through the same movement) daily. I do this as part of a circuit that also includes step-ups and wall press-ups (for now!).  This is not going to be effective. If you want to seriously build muscle, I highly recommend finding a routine that you can follow instead of doing stuff yourself.  First of all, in general, combo exercises are not going to be efficient. This is because the weaker muscle in the combo is going to limit your output. For example, your biceps are much weaker than your shoulders. So any weight that is appropriate for the biceps curl is going to be too easy for a shoulder press.  Secondly, circuit style training is going to be mostly cardio, and you will get tired out from cardio. That is not what you want.  >By the fiftieth lift I'm tired and almost ready to drop the weights, but I'm consistently managing it and feeling great, if uncertain whether this is the best way to go about things.

Keep track of how many more reps you think you could do after 10. If you could do 2 reps or more reps, increase the weight next time.  It might take a month or two, but you'll eventually get to the point where the weight is heavy enough in a safe manner.  Also take note that your working weight should go up with time as you make gains. A progression method like the one I outline will generally work for that too.

For a beginner, depending on the muscle group, I would recommend anywhere between 3-10 sets per week.

fitness,1lswrw6,n1n0y3h,2025-07-06T14:27:40,"I've been trying to improve my technique on the first rep of deadlifts, which is the hardest and arguably the most important rep.  My objective is to use more of my hamstrings and glutes on that first rep, and less of my back. I feel it's something I really need to work on.  I've noticed something curious though, and despite the fact I've been consuming a lot of fitness content over the past years, I haven't seen this topic mentioned, so I'm assuming it's a me problem:  When I don't use straps and I initiate the setup phase from the standing position, I feel like I'm able to get myself in a somewhat proper pulling position, in which I'm using more of my lower body to lift the weight.  At the same time, when I use straps, I am forced to initiate the setup phase from the ground/near the barbell, to say so. When doing it this way, I feel like I am not able to reach the same setup as mentioned before, and that I use more of my back/lower back to pull the BB.  I'm not sure if it's the different starting point of the setup, or simply the fact that the straps constrain me, but I really believe something is not quite as it should be. As if I can't get my hips high enough or something similar.  Or perhaps it's just the fact that when I lift without straps I use lower weights and my technique improves, who knows, although I kind of doubt it.   Anyways, am I doing something wrong?

Sometimes that looks like bench press ‚Äì which primarily hits the chest (but also triceps and shoulders a little bit), and sometimes that looks like skull crushers ‚Äì which only hit triceps. I generally don‚Äôt do complex lifts like squats, deadlifts, clean & jerk, etc.  It‚Äôs pretty intuitive to me that it wouldn‚Äôt be wise to hit every muscle with an equal amount of volume. Back to the push example ‚Äì the chest is huge, and most motions that *try* and isolate it still hit supportive push muscles. For those reasons, it seems to me that it would be foolish to do 10 weekly sets for chest, then *also* do 10 sets for triceps. For example ‚Äì my typical split per week is about 8 sets for chest, 4 sets for triceps, 5/6 sets for shoulders. Not 6 sets for everything. I follow the same sort of ideology with lats/rear delts, abs/obliques, etc.  As an extension of this ‚Äì if I wanted to bulk and kick up my volume, I wouldn‚Äôt *just* increase the amount of sets I do for chest.

I‚Äôve seen charts for rep maxes, but that doesn‚Äôt give me a great idea for how much volume I should be doing.

It is going to be hard to build a good routine that way. If you are going to do a 3 day a week routine, I strongly recommend doing full body programming, especially one that is already written so you don't have to do it yourself.  I'll also mention that this is a minimalist routine that you have written. By that, I mean that your total volume is low, and that you're overall just not doing that much. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's worth noting  Looking first at your leg day-- Even though you are doing hyperextensions, I still recommend that you do some sort of hip hinge movement on a leg day, like an RDL or a deadlift. They are critical parts to a good workout program.   You missing direct calf training, which I think is overall good to have in a program. Your overall quad volume volume is low. It's not absolutely terrible, but as I mentioned it's definitely minimalist.   Your push day is also the same way. Overall, your chest volume is on the low side. It's minimalist, but it's not terrible. If you're going to do a triceps isolation, I strongly recommend doing overhead extensions of some kind, in order to work the long head of your triceps, which is missed in your pressing movements.  Your back day is also very minimalist. You are only doing 3 sets of rows and 3 sets of lat pulldowns for your heavy pulls per week, which on the low end.   Tl;dr  This is a minimalist routine that is low volume. Low volume will eventually hinder your progression, but if you're a total beginner or if you don't really care to progress as efficiently as possible.

It's just that I really wouldn't feel comfortable asking someone to do it.  > It touching is a good way to make sure it's close enough, a lot of back involvement comes from poor leverage from being too over the bar during your pull (which is kind of necessary if the bar is too far from your legs).  Yeah, I definitely do that sometimes. But at the same time it never felt natural/right to me to have the bar that close to my legs. Maybe it's the fact that I was in a bad starting position, that could very well be it.

My quick sketch for a routine would be:  Monday   T1: Squat + Row   T2: RDL   T3: Lat pulldown + Leg Press  Wednesday   T1: BP + OHP   T2: Incline Press   T3: Triceps pulldown, Dips, flys (db or machine, not sure which)  Friday   T1: DL + Pull-ups   T2: Front Squat   T3: Leg Curl + Hamstring Ext  I'm planning on doing these exercises kind of structure-less (aside from the target rep ranges for each tier) for a few weeks just to get a feel for where I'm at with a lot of the exercises, and maybe in a month or two start a structured training cycle, but I'm still not super clear about how progression is meant to work under GZCL. Looking at the example programs in the wiki, I feel like I can just wing it as long as I'm in the target rep range for each tier, and getting close to my T1 training max at the end of each cycle. Is that really all there is to it?",1,False

This is where it gets confusing.  - Active rest 2x a week. - I don't run/do much cardio-I only walk. (I don't really love getting sweaty. Then again I will start if I need to.)

So I'll try to touch on all your concerns...  >Here's what I've got  Your workout schedule seems reasonable.   Active rest is somewhat overrated, just try to find something to do on rest days that involves anything that isn't marinading on a couch, even if it's just running errands. If you own a dog and walk it already, that's enough. This might have to be more deliberate than I'm framing it depending on your circumstances, but it can be as little as taking a short stroll around your neighborhood (assuming it's safe and you don't live in a car-brain hellscape.)    >I don't really love getting sweaty.  You never really have to get sweaty unless you're a naturally sweaty human or getting sweaty is a byproduct of the effort required to progress. Sometimes it's unavoidable, but it's rarely a requirement.   A stationary bike with a fan is really easy way to get a lot of high quality cardio without sweating. If you have somewhere you can swim, you won't notice if you do get sweaty, so that's kind of a lifehack.  >I'm a little scared to go to the gym because I don't know how to use anything and definetly afraid of looking silly  No one will think anything about you (except maybe *'dayum, who is this new cutie at the gym?'*.) Everyone at the gym is there for themselves, but also had to learn at first. No one walked in with years of knowledge, built in movement patterns, or extensive knowledge about every machine that's ever been made (they usually have a little placard telling you how to use them.)  Go learn. Failure is how you grow, not how we wither. You will not be using anything heavy enough to seriously hurt yourself for a very long time (unless you drop something on your foot, don't do that.)  If you want to prep a bit, watch some Youtube videos on the movements you want to do before you go and try to emulate what they do. Watch how-to videos from channels like Squat University, Alan Thrall, Juggernaut Training... **not influencers**. If none of those jive with you, look for creators that actually own gyms, compete in a strength sports, or train athletes.   Go in with a plan (see: find a workout on the wiki you like) and do your best to execute it. Don't question the plan you choose, just do it for a few months and you'll be very proficient at it, I promise.  >I don't use protein powder because it's really overwhelming and I'm scared of hurting my liver, bloating, digestion, and other side effects  If you can drink milk without experiencing these problems, you'll be totally fine. If you can't, there's always non-milk protein powders. Protein powder is the single best complete source of protein you can consume. It is **incredibly** safe and you will never need to consume enough of it to experience any side effects. As with anything the dose is the poison. Water can kill you if you drink excessive amounts.  >Is what I'm doing enough?   You are the only one who can know this answer.

I'm a generally small person but feel like I have some """"fluff"""" in places like arms and what not.  OK, so a couple of things you need to understand.  In order to be """"toned"""", you need to build muscle. Which means you need to make more muscle. Which means you need to eventually gain weight. I'll just start with that because many times people who want to be """"toned"""" are terrified of gaining weight and thus spin their wheels and get nowhere.  Secondly, the areas of your body you think are """"flabby"""" look that way because you don't have enough muscle there. The solution to making these areas look better/more """"toned"""" is going to be building more muscle. Which again, means eventually you need ot gain weight.  >I'm doing 40-ish minute workouts. I use 5lb, 8lb, 10lb weights, resistance bands, and some other at home equipment.  I'll tell you right now that this is not going to be enough equipment for you to make efficient changes to your physique. Those weights are just too light. To grow muscle you have to lift weights that are heavy to you, at high intensities. Which means you need to go to a gym. There are many great resources beginner lifting programs.  You can do at home calisthenic routines if you want, and lift against your bodyweight. These are also great.  >In my workouts, I'm doing full body stuff every workout - 3 circuits of upper, core, lower. I do 10-12 reps. I never feel crazy sore after but like I did some work. Not really sure when to """"progress"""" weights either, or if what I'm doing is """"enough"""" weight.  This is all not going to be very effective. You need to lift weights, at high intensities, hard. Being sore doesn't matter. I pretty much never get sore after I lift weights. You need to get stronger at different movements over time.  >I'm prioritizing protein (duh) and fiber. Eat majority whole foods and organic - no protein bars. Probably getting around 80g maybe of protein per day if I had to guess. More like 70-80 depending on the day. I don't use protein powder because it's really overwhelming and I'm scared of hurting my liver, bloating, digestion, and other side effects. I only want to use organic stuff and there's just so many options...I don't really know.  This is very complicated, so let me make it clearer for you-- eventually, you need to eat enough to gain weight if you want to make significant changes in your physique. In the beginning, it's OK to not do that, but you just need to make sure to get a decent amount of protein.  If you don't want to ever touch protein powder, it will be much harder to do that. But it's up to you.  >Is what I'm doing enough?   I would guess right now, no. Just because it sounds like you are doing circuit style training and just randomly moving weights around, and not doing a clear program where you are getting stronger and adding weight to your exercises.  > Should I make my days upper body, legs, core/back, instead?  I would follow a 3 day a week program that is centered around lifting weights.  >Should I start using protein powder?  I highly recommend it, just for convenience.  >Is 3x a week, 40 minutes enough?  On a proven program, where you lift heavy weights, absolutely. On a homebrew program where you randomly move weights around, probably not.",3,False

fitness,1lre390,n1cbgru,2025-07-04T17:43:52,"Trying to understand the so-called """"yo-yo effect"""" after dieting. I'm reading """"Project Nutrition"""" by Andrea Biasci.  It says that when you gain a lot of weight and adipocites can no longer contain all that fat, they start multiplying, but then if you lose it, they """"shrink"""" but their number stays the same. This makes it easy to regain weight.  But it doesn't dig into the details and I'm curious about the mechanism of action behind that.  What I don't understand is that you need calories to fill those adipocites again. The fact that you have more adipocites now won't change that. So I don't see any reason to gain more weight than before if your caloric superavit is the same.  What I've googled:  * They give the analogy of making more bottles to contain all that oil, then the second time you fill them, the bottles are already there. I understand the analogy but this doesn't tell me why they fill faster than before with the same amount of oil per day. * They say more adipocites produce more leptin, causing you to eat more, so the caloric superavit is no longer the same. Well, that's not what I found on wikipedia which says leptin stimulates you to eat¬†*less*, not more.  What comes to my mind:  * Does multiplying adipocites require energy? So that the second time you gain weight you don't have to spend energy on that? * The book says muscle cells and adipocites compete to absorb glucose and fats from blood through GLUT4 receptors. Does a high number of adipocites outcompete muscle tissues more easily?  Any other mechanisms I haven't found or haven't thought about?  Repeat, trying to understand the mechanism of action why¬†*the same amount of calories*¬†will make you fat faster the second time (or why it is not ok to assume it is the same amount of calories).  I'm curious because the recommendation is not to gain a lot of weight and lose it... which kinda conflicts with the standard strategy of bulking and cutting (except probably that the fat gained during a bulk is a lot smaller than what would cause this effect).",2,False

Now lifting consistently and cutting aggressively (~1600 kcal deficit). Feeling good so far, but wondering if it‚Äôs too much too fast to sustain or retain muscle. Goal: 100‚Äì105kg.  ----------------------  I'm wondering if I'm doing/cutting too much right now.  I'm 34M, 184cm. I used to weigh 216kg and got down to 114kg after a year on a major deficit‚Äî800kcal intake for 3 months initially, then 1500kcals daily. This was medically supervised. I wasn't caring about protein, wasn‚Äôt caring about weight training, and so the end result was a loose, flabby mess with bony shoulders (see my posts).  My goal is 100‚Äì105kg, but I decided to take a break from the loss to put on muscle. I've been consistently doing 3 lifting sessions a week for 5 months now, but my weight shot back up to 138kg because old eating habits came back. I'm pretty happy with the muscle growth I've seen so far, but I know it will slow down‚Äîespecially now that I‚Äôm back on a cut.  I'm eating around 1750kcal during the week and about 2200kcal on weekends. I get 150‚Äì160g of protein a day. I've added in 2 HIIT-ish sessions a week: I spend 35 minutes on a cross-trainer/elliptical and alternate between gentle and 8‚Äì9 RPE work. I also go for a long 2‚Äì3 hour walk each week. I've been at this for 3 weeks and I feel good generally, but I'm worried my cut is too quick.  I estimate my TDEE to be around 3500kcal, which means I'm (on average) running a daily deficit of about 1600kcal. My gym performance suffered initially for the first week back on a cut, but I'm back to progressing on strength and don‚Äôt feel like my performance is suffering now.  I was initially planning to stick to this level of cut for just 6 weeks to coincide with a trip I'm going on, and then do something more gentle afterwards.

I could only do 4 assisted pull ups with 135lb of assistance. I can now do 8 pulls ups with 85lb of assistance. I could only plank for 30-40 sec. I can now plank 60-75sec.  I've been following the Gluteal Goddess program this year and am about to finish it for the second time.

On the positive side, I have seen my glutes becoming perkier overall, which is great!  That said, I‚Äôm now looking to create my own routine based on the four exercise categories that Bret Contreras recommends, while incorporating the exercises I enjoyed most from the program. **My main goals** are to build my upper glutes and tone my back, especially my lower back, where I tend to carry extra fat and feel the least toned. As well as working my way up to higher reps  I understand that **diet and protein intake** play a major role in these changes, and I‚Äôve been steadily improving in that area by working with a dietician. My cal intake is 1800 and a goal of 120g protein Since the beginning of the year, I‚Äôve lost 24 pounds, slow and steady, which I know is a healthy and sustainable pace. Now, I just want to make sure I‚Äôm building muscle and focusing on the right areas as I continue to lose weight.     Is there any exercise i should substitute or add? Should I up or lower my sets or reps? The sets and reps i put are based on what i was doing with the program I am currently doing  **My plan to overload** is to add 2.5-5lb each week or up the reps per set. On days I can't lift heavy like during my period, I will lower the weight, up the reps and hold to still be able to challenge my self.",1,False

fitness,1lre390,n1cht4y,2025-07-04T18:16:31,"First of all, you should know that """"toning"""" muscles is not something you can do. You cannot tone your back.  Tigeraid's response is great and 100% accurate. You cannot selectively lose fat in or """"tone"""" any area.  For your workout specifically:  You are missing chest and shoulder work entirely. This is not good. You are lifting to build a nice looking physique. Trust me when I say that, as a woman, you still want to work your chest and shoulders.  Secondly, I am a bit worried that you are doing random glute exercises at low intensity. You just have *so many* exercises targeting your glutes, and I don't think you need this many. I am worried that you have this mentality that the more glute work you do, the better they will look. This is not the case.   You need to make sure that you are lifting at high intensity, bringing yourself very close to failure. The fact that all of your leg work is at high rep ranges makes me a bit worried that you're doing a bunch of pump work that isn't going to get you anywhere.  I highly recommend lifting at high intensities at lower rep ranges for at least some of your lifts. At the very least, it'll be more practical.  Lower body work should ideally be done just a couple times a week, at high intensity. You're doing lower body work three times a week, with a bunch of different exercises.

And it sounds like you're doing great there! Training your lower back MORE will make the muscle bigger, not reduce the fat.  Also, where you store your fat is purely genetic and sometimes those last little places are difficult or impossible to deal with.  There's also the possibility of loose skin--in my case, I lost over 100 lbs, and even at my lowest bf%, I still had similar """"lower back fat"""" which was actually just loose skin hanging there. No amount of training is going to change it.  Train your whole body, including your posterior chain.  Focusing on one or two areas will only lead to frustration.  Also, if your ass, hips, lats, shoulders and arms get a little bigger, have a little more definition and look more athletic, you might suddenly not care or even notice your little bit of back fat.",3,False

Whatever you want until 3 months before your event, practice at competition weight 1 month before your event  > Getting strong and lean require opposite diets--a calorie surplus and a calorie deficit, respectively. How and when would these be implemented?  Your limiting factor in this situation is the length of your off-season rather than your goals or weaknesses. Prioritize accordingly, you can't do everything at once  > Maybe eat a slight surplus during the off-season to get stronger, then eat at a deficit during a """"pre-season"""" to cut some excess fat, and maintain during season?  IMO a pre-season should be dedicated to technique and strategy work.

I say this because, in your case, you need to be (relatively) lower weight/fat during your competition.  Me, on the other hand, I need to get as much food into me and as much size as possible leading up to a comp. In my case, that's hovering around 225-230, since my division is under 231lbs.  Others will even eat to be much bigger, 240-250 lbs, and then do water cuts, like an MMA fighter.  I actually do my cuts in the OFF-SEASON, instead.  Further still, I wouldn't be surprised if a stick-n-ball athlete would probably mostly want to maintain for most of a season, maybe just a little bulk in the winter to try and gain some muscle.  There's another school of thought (and again, I'm NOT a running expert) that says being lean is good and all, but being depleted isn't, and they'd rather have a little extra mass if it means they can put the power down consistently through the season.  Plus actually fuel themselves for the race, too.

On their bodybuilding days, they do full body splits and lift at high intensities.  I think this style of training is going to be better/more efficient in the long run. Dedicated time to lifting weights and building muscle is going to be more efficient than half assing it after hard climbing sessions, even if you are """"only"""" doing it two days a week.  Another thing I want to note is that for most people, having a """"basic aesthetic body"""" will mean gaining a lot of muscle.   Many people think that being """"not fat with some muscle tone"""" comes down to losing fat and gaining a little bit of muscle. This is not true. Most people have basically no muscle. For most people, that look they are going for involves gaining a significant amount of muscle, like 10-20lbs, over an extended period.   Gaining muscle and having periods where you are at a calorie surplus means gaining weight, which is going to make bouldering harder. You're not going to be able to gain a significant amount of muscle without a period of dedicated weight gain. But once you gain the muscle, cutting down is much easier and much faster.  My main point is this-- most people will be super happy if they reach an early intermediate bodybuilding physique. That is not hard at all. It just takes time, and dedicated training/lifestyle choices. Once you reach that physique, maintaining it is extremely easy and you basically get it for free with minimal effort.

I personally don't enjoy full body workouts but that's usually what is recommended for beginners. But it's a decent set of exercises that aren't too challenging as far as form goes (compared to a bench/squat/deadlift based routine).  Beyond that, you're probably fine doing 2 sets (3 max) instead of 3-4, just try to use a weight that is challenging. You should be putting out high effort every set, don't """"save your energy"""" because it's a long workout.  As a beginner, you'll make good gains as long as you're showing up and pushing yourself. Don't stress too much about what your routine is, just try to hit every muscle group 2-3 times per week. If you wanted to tweak the routine, you want the following:  **Motion (example lift)**  Vertical push (shoulder press machine)  Vertical pull (lat pull down machine)  Horizontal push (chest press)  Horizontal pull (seated cable row)  Elbow flexion (curls)  Elbow extension (tricep pushdowns)  Knee flexion (hamstring curl)  Knee extension (leg extension)  Calves (standing calf raises)  Then as you go further you can add to the lower body, ideally a pushing motion like a leg press or a hack squat. Then even further than that would be a hip hinge motion like a Romanian Deadlift. And for the upper body you'd probably want to add some shoulder work, like lateral raises and rear delt flys.  In short, pick a program and stick with it for a while, like 8-12 weeks. Then pick a new one. Repeat. The important thing is that you're working hard and you're consistent.

Assuming you are going to the gym 6x a week, so you are running this twice per week--  Your pull day has chin-ups, but you're only doing 3x2. I think that's too few reps. I would first develop more strength, or lose weight, before you do these. This is just because you're not strong enough yet to accumulate very many quality reps for these. I would strongly recommend doing them assisted for now, and do more reps.  Otherwise though, if you're running this twice a week, I think the total volume for your back/biceps is pretty good.   Your push day is very minimalistic, but not inherently bad either. You're got your presses, which will cover your chest. My biggest critique here is that I strongly recommend doing overhead triceps work for the long head of your triceps. This is very commonly missed in programs. This is an easy fix. Just replace your bench dips with overhead extensions.  Your leg day is where you are running into a lot of issues. As Alakazam mentioned, you are completely missing a hip hinge movement, which means you are not doing an RDL or a Deadlift. Your overall quad volume is super low-- 3 sets of squats twice a week is not enough by itself for your quads. Your glute work is also probably not very high, considering that your glute bridges are (most likely) not particularly stimulating. You are doing no ab isolations or calf isolations, both of which I consider very important. This however is not a particularly difficult fix.

One reason why I don't frequently recommend GZCLP is that 3x10 on the Deadlift is just not very realistic for many people, and 3 sets of 10 reps for deadlift is not going to be in line with many people's goals.

You're almost certainly not fully recovered in between. And as a result your ability to set PRs will suffer. But I want to challenge your thinking a bit.  If you spent 6 months doing deadlifts on higher reps (e.g. 6-10) - never testing your 1 rep PR. Then at the end of 6 months tested your PR and it was much higher - when did you get stronger?  * the moment you tested your PR? * incrementally during the 6 months?  The answer is pretty obvious. And the point is: you don't have to be setting PRs to be getting stronger.  Getting stronger is more about the exertion you output than the amount of weight. Increasing the weight is just a means to an end and not the end itself. Being in a constant state of fatigue also means a constant state of recovery, which is when actual changes happen.

While also allowing for more overall volume.   GZCLP was written to be primarily a transition program anyway. [Literally the first line in the GZCLP article says](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/02/gzcl-applications-adaptations.html):   >  Novice lifters and coaches are familiar with traditional, popular models of linear progression programs. Starting Strength, Greyskull, etc. are all the top performers in this class of programming for a person new to strength training. As an option, these lifters can use GZCLP to transfer into a progression scheme with a GZCL format that eventually morphs into their own personalized GZCL program.   And if you scroll down:  > Once GZCLP recovery is stabilized and progression through two to three cycles is complete adding volume from the bottom up in order to more completely transfer to a truer GZCL approach is recommended. This approach is detailed below.   When they say cycles, they mean every 4 workouts.   Meaning, every 2-3 weeks or so, you're suppose to be adding volume to the T3s. This is why I really like GZCLP as a program for new lifters: because it's not a static program. It slowly builds volume and work capacity. And the way it's written, by the time you're getting about 2-3 additional T3 movements, you shift your upper back work to be a t2 movement, and then you adjust your sets, reps and percentages a bit on the T1s, and you're suddenly doing a custom non-liner GZCL program.  GZCLP is not meant to be a static program. It's meant to be a program where you build volume over time,",1,False

GZCLP makes you do 15 reps on your first two sets, but it doesn't allow you to progress until you do 25 reps on your last set. That doesn't make any sense. If you can do 25 reps with a weight on set 3, it means that sets 1 and 2 are way, way, way too easy for you. They are literally junk volume that will grow no muscle.  Secondly, very few people are going to be doing 55 total reps of an isolation movement and stay focused through the entire thing. That's just not realistic. High rep sets are very mentally challenging, and most people cannot focus through 55 total reps.  GZCLP, from top to bottom, is not a bodybuilding program.

Speaking of front squats, my view on front squats has always been-- make sure the juice is worth the squeeze. They are great, but they're also really technically challenging, and I would make sure that you feel like they are worth it. If you're never going to do an Olympic lift, or if you don't really love them, I might not do them.  Your hamstring volume is also low. You are only doing 3 sets of deadlifts in the entire week.

fitness,1lowtn1,n0w0cah,2025-07-02T04:34:53,"Assuming your goal is to build muscle, I would consider this a minimalistic routine. By that, I mean that the total amount of time you're spending in the gym each day is very low, which means that you're not going to cover all of your bases.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you are a beginner. You'll still make progress-- just not as efficiently or as quickly as you would if you did more.  However, even for a minimalist program, I would say that this one is not very efficient. In no particular order  0. You are missing a hip hinge movement, which is a critical piece to any program. I recommend adding RDLs to one of your days, with the barbell. You can replace your leg curls with an RDL and that would be much better.  1. You are doing no shoulder work at all, pretty much. The only thing you are getting is secondary work from your chest press. You are missing a vertical push, which is very important to any program. I recommend adding a vertical shoulder press to one of your days. If your goal is aesthetics, I recommend adding a lateral raise to one of your days.  2. You do not do overhead triceps work. This is important if your goal is to build an aesthetic physique. It is less important if your goal is general fitness. I recommend replacing the pushdown with overhead extensions.  3.  You don't do any direct ab work or direct calf work. Again, these are less important if your goal is general fitness, but much more important if your goal is aesthetic oriented. I recommend adding direct ab work and calf work.  4. Your total glute work is very low. I recommend adding more. Replacing hamstring curls with RDLs would already be a great start.  If you want to reduce volume to give yourself approximately the same amount of total sets, I would start by cutting volume from your biceps curls and chest flyes, since those are the most redundant exercises you have. If you're only doing 10-12 sets per workout you don't need 6 weekly sets of biceps curls, or 6 weekly sets of chest. That's like 1/3rd of your total workout dedicated to those muscles.  >Is it worth getting a personal trainer? They cost 50 per session which is already the cost of 1 month of the membership.  In my opinion no. Most personal trainers at gyms are bad.  >How can I tell if my form is good by myself. I can't go to the gym with anyone else and sometimes I feel like its off.

Been sedentary almost my whole life (some attempts at running here and there, but nothing consistent). I'm skinnyfat; more than enough fat (I guess around 30%), but not so much muscle.  Right now I'm following the Recommended Routine from r/bodyweightfitness (5 weeks in), and my main goal is just being able to do some basic calisthenic movements: push-ups, pull-ups, dips, bodyweight rows - and learn handstands along the way! It's been really enjoyable, and I'm doing some progress through different variations of exercises (like lowering the incline for push-ups, and getting closer to horizontal bodyweight rows).  But it's been kind of a hassle training at the park all the time, as the weather isn't always nice. And for various reasons I don't want to bother installing equipment at home (renting sucks).

Is this solid? I honestly feel kind of silly with the idea of having access to barbells and using them only for lower body, but then again achieving basic competency in calisthenics (with that improving strength and hopefully acquiring some muscle mass) is my main goal; so, for that, am I in the right path?

You only do ~3-4 things, and you only need to hit half of the 'core 6 movements' (horizontal push/pull, vertical push/pull, hip hinge, squat) each workout, which works out to 1 push, 1 pull, and 1 leg movement.   Core work is bullshit since bracing does that for you, working out your arms besides direct side delt work is basically pointless, anything that hits your traps directly is a waste of time... These are movements you add later when doing just the compounds isn't enough anymore, which is never a beginner problem.  You also only need to do ~5 sets since you don't have enough muscle to require higher volumes to improve. The whole 'weekly set volume' optimization stuff happens after you stop growing, not from day 1. These are problems that don't exist for beginners.  >Is a Upper Lower split not recommended for the first few months or atleast 1 month of training?  I personally think Upper/Lower splits are probably better than most A/B-type beginner programs because you do a larger variety of movements, which is more engaging and I think less boring, but in terms of results they aren't necessarily better.",7,False

One thing from the text:  > If your issue has not improved within that timeline then we don't recommend to continue and should find another form of care to try.  I might change the wording of this one. Suggests that if you're not better within a month to try something else. Since """"improvement"""" might mean anything from 10% better to 100% better we don't want to send the wrong message. Maybe word it along the lines of, """"If you haven't seen a noticeable improvement in the level of pain, or its duration, after a month of care, it might be time to ask your doctor to re-state your goals, or consider another form of care.

chiropractic,oi7ag1,h4vbo6o,2021-07-12T00:56:43,"Great post. I would make a couple addendums or edits to point 1 and 2 if you think it is appropriate.   For point 1, I've always told people to ask friends/family who they have used with results and use that as a starting point. Nothing against FTCA, but a couple docs are in the directory near my practice and they are reallllyy crappy. It's like any online directory though--you don't know what you will get. Same for the technique directories. I think those are good recommendations on how to find someone still, since it is a jumping off place. Maybe it would be worth adding to ask someone they trust who they use?  For point 2, we do get a lot of questions about ring-dinger. I'm not a big fan of naming the doc or even the technique in the point, since it brings more notoriety. Maybe the point can be a warning about youtube/instagram chiropractors? Let patients know that what they see on social media is really just an ad, and not reality.  Just a couple thoughts! Thanks for typing everything up.

chiropractic,oi7ag1,h4vlo33,2021-07-12T02:27:47,"A good chiro and good PT may actually have a lot of overlap. As the other use said, chiro is more geared toward manipulation and PTs are more geared toward exercise but it doesn't mean either one can't do the other. There are definitely good/bad chiros and PTs, so it's best to find referrals based on the best individual for your needs.  And the role that chiros play are concentrating on nonoperative spine pain. Standard medical care doesn't really handle these cases the best and skip to surgery pretty quickly even if it's not necessary. A study showed that patients who saw a chiro first only 1.5% had surgery, while those who saw a surgeon first 42.7% had surgery (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23238486/).

PT is generally soft-tissue focused on with occasional manipulation of joints. Chiropractors have much more training on joint manipulation than any other profession/specialty.
