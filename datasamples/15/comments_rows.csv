n4nipw1,1m6g92y,health,zenboi92,"So one of the many scary things about the measles virus is that it actually causes immune amnesia. The virus literally destroys the immune cells that are responsible for storing prior immunity to other pathogens. Not to mention, if the person is sick for long enough, the virus makes easy way for brain infections, phenomena, or death.

Sure, natural infection creates _specific_ measles immunity, but at what cost? The damage done to the immune system, compounded with deadly symptoms of the disease, majorly outweighs the protection gained from infection.

Plus infants and children are _tiny_, which means their risk of experiencing acute fluid build-up and inflammation are more severe. It’s no bueno.

FYI, the virus that comes in the vaccine is essentially inert. The vaccine provides the natural immunity to the body without it having to get so sick and risk harming the immune system.

n4nsgf3,1m6an08,chiropractic,Kelpie-ardbeg,"Hopefully it’s not one of those “2 free sessions” that don’t actually include treatment. Usually the first visit is just a PE and often involves unnecessary x-rays for posture and alignment assessment then the second is a “report of findings” where they pitch a treatment plan that runs for months with multiple sessions a week. If that’s how this clinic works, you’re probably better off finding another one. This type of clinics will give you the exact same adjustments when you come in with non spinal issues. 

As for adjustments that take 2–3 minutes, that’s pretty normal. It’s only an issue if you’re expecting more than just an adjustment. If you’ve got peripheral joint issues or sports-related goals, look for a clinic that runs 30 or 45 minute sessions.",2025-07-23 05:03:28+00,1,t3_1m6an08,https://reddit.com/r/Chiropractic/comments/1m6an08/thoughts_on_the_legitimacy_of_my_new_chiropractor/n4nsgf3/,,,,,,

>In this study, we demonstrate that golden hamsters develop persistent and late-onset neurological symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection in a model **without social or somatization influence**. We describe hamsters as a robust animal model of long COVID and provide evidence that viral and neuro-immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem, which exhibits a neurodegenerative signature characterized by an elevated innate immune response and impaired neurotransmission and energy metabolism. This model also illustrates the complexity of long COVID with clinical manifestations varying according to time, sex, and viral variants. Finally, this study highlights that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to persist in the brain and that the brainstem may act as a reservoir of infectious virus during the post-acute phases of COVID-19.",2025-07-23 08:23:09+00,1,t3_1m6iazk,https://reddit.com/r/Health/comments/1m6iazk/the_pandemic_may_have_aged_our_brains_even_before/n4oeqdn/,,,,,,
