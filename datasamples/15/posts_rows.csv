1m634t7,chiropractic,Connect_Ad_7758,Feeling Discouraged,"I’m currently a Tri 6 and I am feeling very discouraged in everything right now. Lately, I am on the side of social media that hates chiropractors and are trying to convince everyone we are quacks. I’m having a hard time because I truly love chiropractic and I’ve seen how it has changed my life. Chiropractic helped me get out of excruciating pain, and it hurts when people tell me that chiropractic is a placebo affect. I’m also having a hard time because I had a steady plan for graduating school and who I was going to work for, but that doctor recently sold his practice. The situation is really throwing me through a loop because now I feel like I’m having an identity crisis of what I truly want to specialize in. 

Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated! Just a lost student trying to figure out life haha. ",2025-07-23 06:40:52+00,8,23,https://reddit.com/r/Chiropractic/comments/1m634t7/feeling_discouraged/

1m6an08,chiropractic,Low_Impress_1910,Thoughts on the legitimacy of my new Chiropractor,"Hey folks,

I figured I’d come straight to the community since I would imagine you all may be able to sniff out someone who may be taking advantage of people, as opposed to offering actual help. 

Years ago, I used to see a chiropractor, and it was actually the same one my parents went to see for many years. But after much time (and money) spent with him, I found that he was just performing a 2-3 min adjustment routine on most of not all of his patients in a very similar manner. Which is what has unfortunately caused my hesitation and doubts in ever wanting to visit one again. 

Fast forward to today, I went for an initial evaluation with a small town chiropractor in my new city, an older guy, but his first appointment with me didn’t even involve any sort of adjustments. More asking me what my core concerns were, where the pain was and offered me the free physical examination. The only thing I had to pay (with insurance) was for X-rays and a foot scan - since he could see off the bat that I lean heavily on one side and pronate badly based on my shoes. 

This in itself was a much more positive experience, but wanted to gauge the community on if this gentleman seems like he’s doing the practice justice. My only hesitation is honestly the “foot levelers” they may try to sell me on with that foot scan.
